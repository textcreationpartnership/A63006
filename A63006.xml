            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:36048:3"/>I have, if it may be, to put an end to the whole, hath prompted me to make the more haſt to preſent your Lordſhip, and the World with this of Baptiſm in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>Two things there are in it, which I thought my ſelf moſt concern'd to clear, and which therefore I have employ'd all requiſite diligence on, the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and <hi>Infant-Baptiſm:</hi> The former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my opinion the

<pb facs="tcp:36048:4"/>baptized in our Infancy, or at leaſt have been baptized by thoſe that were.</p>
            <p>Throughout the whole Treatiſe I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to retrive the antient notion of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to ſhew what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are annexed to it; and what duties it either involves, or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to.

            <p>THe Heathen themſelves not without the knowledge of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other World, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of natural Religion to bring them to the happineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Occaſion taken by them from thence to enquire after other ways of obtaining it, and by the Devil to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the <hi>myſteries</hi> of their reſpective Deities as the only proper means of compaſſing it. Thoſe myſteries every where initiated into by the Rite of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> partly through Men's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of their paſt ſins, and which
<pb facs="tcp:36048:6"/>they judged it but meet they ſhould be ſome way purged from, and partly through the policy of the Devil, who thereby thought to procure the greater veneration to them: That as it was a Rite, which was in uſe among God's own people, ſo naturally apt to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Mens minds their paſſing from a ſinful to a holy Eſtate. Of what Service the <hi>Heathens</hi> uſe of this Rite is toward the commendation of the <hi>Chriſtians Baptiſm,</hi> and a tranſition from thence to the uſe of it among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Which is not only prov'd at large out of the Jewiſh Writings, and ſeveral particulars of that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm remark'd, but that uſage far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm'd by ſeveral concurring proofs; ſuch as is in particular the no appearance there is otherwiſe of any initiation of the Jewiſh Women, the Baptizing of the whole Nation in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and a remarkable alluſion to it in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Diſcourſe to <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> The ſilence of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> concerning that Rite ſhewn to be of no force, becauſe though it take notice of the firſt <hi>Jews</hi> being under the Cloud, and paſſing through the Red
<pb facs="tcp:36048:6"/>Sea, yet it takes no notice at all of their being Baptized in them, or of their Eating, and Drinking that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Repaſt whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The Baptiſm of Chriſtians co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by our Saviour from that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and may therefore, (where it appears not, that he hath made an alteration) receive an elucidation from it. <hi>p. 1.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:36048:7"/>execution of his Prophetical Office.

A more juſt account from the Scripture of its being truly, and properly a ſin, partly from its having

Theſe latter ones propoſed to be conſidered, and entrance made with the conſideration of what God obligeth himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon the Baptized, called by the Church, <hi>An inward, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Grace.</hi> Which inward, and ſpiritual Grace is ſhewn to be of two ſorts, to wit, ſuch as tend more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to our ſpiritual, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare, or ſuch as only qualifie us for thoſe Graces, that do ſo. To the former ſort are reckon'd that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpiritual Grace, which tends to free us from the guilt of ſin, called by the Church <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin;</hi> That which tends to free us from the pollution of ſin, called by our Catechiſm <hi>A death unto it;</hi> And that, which tends to introduce the contrary purity, and hath the name of a <hi>New birth unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> To the latter ſort is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned <hi>our union to that Body,</hi> of which Chriſt Jeſus is the Head, and by means whereof he diſpenſeth the former Graces to us. Each of theſe reſum'd, and conſidered in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſhewn to be, what they are

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36048:18"/>ſome light from it toward the clearing of our own; And partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may appear both from the one, and the others Baptiſm, that Chriſtianity hath laid no other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on us, than what the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon of Mankind, or a more early Tradition prompted others to the imbracing of.</p>
               <p>For the underſtanding whereof we are to know, that as the Heathen themſelves were not without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion of another World, wherein the Souls of Men ſhould be treated according to their demeanour here; So they alike ſaw, or at leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that they could not expect a happy <hi>futurity</hi> by a bare compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with thoſe rules, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion ſuggeſted to them: Partly, becauſe they ſaw but too well that they could never arrive at a perfect compliance with them, by which means they ſhould always ſtand in need of the divine favour, and forgiveneſs; And partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew it to be in the power of their offended Deities to preſcribe what ways, and means they thought good for Men's obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36048:18"/>a reconciliation with them. This therefore being the general, and indeed natural ſenſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and not a little quickned at the firſt by what they might learn from God's own people concerning the Sacrifices, and other Rites, whereby he appointed them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone him; Men began to look out every where for proper means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the favour of their Gods, and the Devil, who was willing by all means to precipitate them into deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did either by himſelf, or his Agents ſuggeſt ſuch, as might grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe their hopes, but withal not only no way profit them, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch their minds ſo much the more. Only leſt too groſs a deceit ſhould come to be diſcern'd, he took care, among other things, that what he ſuggeſted ſhould be concealed from the generality of Men, and indeed even from thoſe, who were deſirous to underſtand them, till they had approv'd themſelves by a long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and the undergoing of all thoſe things, which were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to them.

               <p>How this way of initiation by Baptiſm came to prevail ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is hard to ſay, and I will not therefore be over poſitive in defining. That, which ſeems to me to be the moſt probable, is, that thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to which this way of initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on belonged, came all out of the ſame forge, even the contrivance of the Devil, and his dependants, to whom, though ignorantly, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then offered<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.20.</note> Sacrifice; That he ſuggeſted ſuch an initiation to them, partly in imitation of thoſe Baptiſms, or waſhings, which God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among his own people, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36048:20"/>as a <hi>Symbol,</hi> which did moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally repreſent to their minds their paſſing from a ſinful to a holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: Sin, by reaſon of the odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, coming to have both the eſteem, and name of <hi>Pollution,</hi> and that therefore, which profeſſed to do it away, beſt repreſented by that Element, which was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to purge away the natural one; In fine, that they, to whom that form of initiation was propos'd, being thereby poſſeſs'd with a good opinion of the ſacredneſs of thoſe myſteries, to which it led, and a hope of its alſo purging them from their former guilt, greedily embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, and made it as ſacred in their own eſteem, as it ſeemed to be in the deſign of thoſe, that inſtituted it. Which moreover they were more eaſily perſuaded into, becauſe they found it much more eaſie thus to waſh away their Sins, than to purge their Conſcience<note n="(g)" place="margin">Heb 9.14.</note> from dead works by repentance, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By theſe degrees, I ſuppoſe, it was, that Baptiſm came, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen, to be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral form of initiating them into their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36048:21"/>reſpective myſteries; And had thoſe myſteries been as ſacred, as their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation into them was ſpecious, it might have ſerv'd to them for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual monument of that inward, and far better purity, which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all thoſe to put on, who hope for approbation from the Divine Majeſty.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36048:22"/>that the Males of the native <hi>Jews</hi> were of Old initiated into that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Baptiſm, or waſhing of the whole body, as well as by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and an Oblation, and the Females by Baptiſm, if not alſo by an Oblation; That the Males of their Proſelytes of Juſtice (ſutably to the Males of thoſe native <hi>Jews,</hi> into whoſe Religion they were admitted) were initiated by Baptiſm, and an Oblation, as well as by Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Females by Baptiſm, and an Oblation; That the Baptiſm of Proſelytes was to be perform'd in a natural receptacle of Waters, as in a River, a Pool, or a Fountain, and the whole body waſhed in it; That there were three Men appointed to preſide over their Baptiſm, and who, as the Baptiſed perſons ſtood in the water, were to lean over them, and twice explain to them ſome of the more weighty, and lighter precepts of the Law; That where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte was a Female, ſhe ſhould be encompaſſed with other Women to preſerve her from being ſeen by the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> and they to depart, when ſhe was to come out of the water;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36048:22"/>That this Baptiſm being rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd was not to be repeated, and that in what condition Proſelytes were baptiz'd, that is to ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſervile or free condition, (for that was then to be profeſs'd) in that they were to abide; That, from the time of their being thus proſelyted, they were for the main accounted of as <hi>Jews,</hi> and had the title of ſuch, that they were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of as perſons new born, yea ſo far, that after that time they were not to own any of their former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; In fine, that that new birth was look'd upon as ſo ſingular, that it gave occaſion to their Cabaliſtical Doctors to teach, that the old Soul of the Proſelyte vaniſhed, and a new one ſucceeded in its place. For all theſe particulars have been obſerv'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Baptiſm whereof we ſpeak, and the Baptiſm it ſelf not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made as antient as <hi>Moſes,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them from that command of God<note n="(m)" place="margin">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36048:23"/>which they were then to enter into.</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers might not ſomewhat overlaſh in making their Baptiſm ſo very ancient, or err in aſſigning the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as the Original thereof, is a thing I mean not to diſpute, and much leſs will I concern my ſelf ſo far in it, as to vindicate them againſt all oppoſers. But as it is hard to believe, they would attribute ſo great an antiquity to that, which was not at leaſt ſomewhat antienter than our Saviour's time, which is all we are concerned to aſſert; So it will be much more hard to detract altogether from their teſtimony, if it hath any concurring proofs, and be otherwiſe fairly defenſible againſt the adverſaries thereof. Now that the teſtimony of the Jewiſh Writers is not without ſome concurring proofs, and ſuch as will at leaſt add to the probability thereof, will appear if we conſider <hi>firſt,</hi> that though Circumciſion both was, and was intended as a means of initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it was ſuch a form of initiation, as was competible only
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36048:23"/>to the <hi>Males.</hi> By which means, if there had been no other form of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, all of the <hi>Female</hi> Sex, who were undoubtedly as much in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, as thoſe of the other, muſt have been debar'd of any viſible Sacrament to aſſure them of their intereſt in it. Which though it be not ſo great an inconvenience, as to enforce altogether the uſe of ſomewhat beſide Circumciſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Females might be initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Fathers, yet will make it reaſonable enough to believe, that God, with whom there is no reſpect of Sexes, appointed ſome form of initiation, by which they might be alike admitted. I ſay <hi>Secondly,</hi> that as Circumciſion was not competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe of the Female Sex, and not unlikely therefore that there might be ſome other ceremony for their initiation; So it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.2.</note>, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God might deal with the <hi>Jews</hi> before, or after, yet all of them, in their paſſage from <hi>Aegypt</hi> unto <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> were <hi>baptized into Moſes in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</hi> For being ſo, it is not difficult to believe, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36048:24"/>the ſame form of initiation might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards have force in thoſe, who were not capable of Circumciſion, yea even in them, that were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, after the Rite of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was over, if it were only to put them in mind, of that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they receiv'd by it: Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when their Euchariſtical Manna, though thence forward not enjoyn'd to be us'd, becauſe it ceaſed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, was yet laid up in the Ark of God<note n="(o)" place="margin">Exod. 32.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> to put them in mind of God's nouriſhing them by it. I ſay <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that though Baptiſm might not be enjoyned at the firſt, or at leaſt enjoyn'd only for the uſe of thoſe, who were not capable of Circumciſion, yet it might by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Governors, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of thoſe Prophets whom God raiſed up among them, be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards added to Circumciſion, both upon the account of their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being commanded to ſanctifie themſelves, and waſh their Cloaths when they appear'd before God at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and as a farther decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to them of the impurity of their Nature, and of that pure, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36048:24"/>holy eſtate, which they entred into. For if their forefathers were, even by the command of God, to ſanctifie themſelves with waſhings toward their entring into Covenant with God at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> what ſhould hinder ſuch of their poſterity, as preſided over that Nation, to make an addition of the like Baptiſm? Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, when all was little enough to admoniſh them of their own natural impurity, and of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that lay upon them of purging themſelves from it. I obſerve <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that though there be not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention in the Scripture of that Baptiſm whereof we ſpeak, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of any like it beſide that of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, which being immediately <hi>from Heaven</hi> ought not to be drawn into example; yet is it ſufficiently intimated by our Saviour, where, upon <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s wondring how a Man could be born of Water, and the Spirit, he with equal wonder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<note n="(p)" place="margin">Joh 3.10.</note>, <hi>Art thou a Maſter of Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> For as that is a ſufficient indication, that the notion our Saviour advanc'd was no ſtranger to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:36048:25"/>and therefore neither ſuch a Baptiſm, as was the ſubject of it; So it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came yet more clear by the Jewiſh Writers repreſenting the Baptiſm of a Proſelyte as giving a new birth unto him: That as it is the ſame in effect with the product of Chriſt's Baptiſm, ſo making it yet more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe, that our Saviour had an eye to it, when he wondred ſo much at <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at that property in his. All which put together, becauſe tending toward the ſame thing, will make it yet more reaſonable to believe, that the Jewiſh Writers ſpake not at adventure, when they repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Rite of Baptiſm as a Rite of their own Nation, and by which both themſelves, and their Proſelytes had been of old initiated, no leſs than by the Rite of Circumciſion. If there be any thing to hinder the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it, it muſt be the ſilence of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> concerning it, or at leaſt concerning the Inſtitution of it. But as we find no great men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even of Circumciſion it ſelf after the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and may therefore the leſs wonder at the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36048:25"/>no mention of Baptiſm, eſpecially if, as it might be, inſtituted after his time; As we find as little mention, even where it might have been more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expected, of the firſt <hi>Jews</hi> being <hi>baptized into Moſes in the Cloud, and in the Sea,</hi> or of their <hi>Eating,</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> that <hi>ſpiritual</hi> repaſt, whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh<note n="(q)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.3, 4.</note>: So there is as little reaſon therefore to wonder at its ſilence concerning this Rite, eſpecially conſidering, what is notorious enough from thence, that God from time to time rais'd up Prophets among them. For their Authority, and Preaching might ſuffice to conſtitute, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a matter of greater moment, than the Rite of Baptiſm, as added to Circumciſion, can be ſuppoſed to have been.</p>
               <p>There being therefore no great doubt to be made of a Baptiſm among the <hi>Jews</hi> antecedent to that of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and our Saviour, it will not be difficult to believe <hi>firſt,</hi> that our Saviour had an eye to it, when he appointed the ſame Rite to initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Men into his Religion: Partly becauſe it was his avowed Profeſſion,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36048:26"/>that he came rather to reform, than deſtroy their former Oeconomy; and partly becauſe he might the more reaſonably hope to bring them over to that faith, which it was an initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation into. It will be as eaſie to believe, <hi>Secondly,</hi> upon the ſcore of the ſame condeſcenſion, and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that Chriſt departed as little as might be from their manner of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it, or from the ends, which it was appointed for among them; ſuch a compliance being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to carry on his deſign of bringing them over to his Religion. The conſequence whereof will be <hi>thirdly,</hi> that where it doth not very plainly appear that Chriſtianity hath made an alteration in it, we interpret the Baptiſm thereof conformably to that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been tranſcrib'd. How much more then, where there are any fair hints in Chriſtianity of its ſymbolizing with the Doctrine of the other? The reſult of which will be <hi>fourthly,</hi> our having recourſe upon occaſion to the Baptiſm of the <hi>Jews</hi> for the better clearing, or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Doctrine of our own.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36048:26"/>Which as I ſhall therefore not fail to do as often as their Writings ſhall furniſh matter for it; ſo having ſaid thus much concerning their Baptiſm, and that of the Heathen, I will paſs on to the Baptiſm of the Chriſtians, and confine my ſelf yet more ſtrictly to the conſideration of it.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36048:28"/>to have been for his making them after the ſame manner with thoſe of <hi>Judea;</hi> From Chriſt's repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the neceſſity of being <hi>born again of water, and the ſpirit,</hi> which is ſhewn at large to be meant of a true, and proper Baptiſm; As, in fine, from Chriſt's telling S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ask'd the waſhing of his Hands, and Head, as well as Feet, that <hi>he, who had been waſhed, needeth not ſave to waſh his feet.</hi> An anſwer to the ſuppoſed ſilence of the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſo early a Baptiſm, and that ſhewn to be neither a perfect ſilence, nor an unaccountable one.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOW the firſt thing to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after is the Inſtitution of it, and ſo much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though there is no doubt as to the thing it ſelf, yet there is as to the firſt beginning of it. For there are, who have thought this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have been firſt inſtituted by our Saviour immediately before his Aſcenſion, and when he gave command to his Diſciples<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> to <hi>go, and teach,</hi> or diſciple <hi>all Nations,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36048:28"/>baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And I willingly grant (becauſe our Saviour was <hi>ſent only</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Matt. 15.24.</note> 
                  <hi>to the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of Iſrael</hi>) that that was the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it, as to that more <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral extent</hi> it was to have in the World, and it may be too as to that clear, and explicit profeſſion of the Trinity, into the Names of which our Saviour afterwards commanded to baptize: Becauſe ſuch Doctrines as that were to be poured into the Diſciples by dgrees, and according as they ſhould be able to receive them. But that the Sacrament it ſelf had a more early Inſtitution, will appear from the mention there is of our Saviour's baptizing long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or at leaſt of his Diſciples do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by his Commiſſion, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
               <p>For the clearing whereof we are to know, that whatſoever he may be thought to have done, before he firſt paſſed into <hi>Judaea</hi> after his own Baptiſm by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, yet <hi>there</hi> he<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3.22.</note>, or his <hi>Diſciples</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 4.2.</note> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; yea to ſo great a number,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36048:29"/>that <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples<note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 3.26.</note> affirmed to their Maſter, that <hi>all men came to him,</hi> and it; and news was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought to the <hi>Phariſees</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Joh. 4.1.</note>, that he made, and baptized more Diſciples, than <hi>John</hi> himſelf. Into what profeſſion is not difficult to conjecture from our Saviour's being ſaid to <hi>make</hi>

                  <hi>Diſciples</hi> by it, and from the Baptiſt's affirming in allowance of our Saviour's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that he that believed on the Son<note n="(e)" place="margin">Joh. 3.36.</note>, ſhould have everlaſting Life, but he, <hi>that believed not the Son, ſhould not ſee life, but,</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, have the <hi>wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on him.</hi> For what could that aſſertion have ſignified toward the legitimating of our Saviour's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, eſpecially when <hi>John</hi> himſelf admoniſh'd Men by his <hi>to believe on him, that ſhould come after him</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Acts 19.4.</note>, <hi>that is, on Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> Were it not, that our Saviour, or his Diſciples did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly baptize Men into the belief of him, and of that Auguſt Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſaving power, which was veſted in him as the Meſſiah. Which makes me wonder ſo much the more, that <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">De Bapt. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> ſhould
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36048:29"/>make that Baptiſm of the Diſciples but of the ſame nature with that of <hi>John,</hi> but above all at his asking, how <hi>Chriſt could be ſuppoſed to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize into himſelf, when</hi> he at that <hi>time made it his buſineſs to conceal who, and what he was.</hi> For as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was not wanting<note n="(h)" place="margin">Joh. 1.29, &amp;c.</note> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what he was; ſo our Saviour was ſo far from being reſerv'd as to that particular, that the very firſt of thoſe Diſciples, that came to him, did both acknowledge him<note n="(i)" place="margin">Joh. 41.45.</note> as the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> immediately, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as ſuch to other Men.</p>
               <p>But let us riſe yet higher, than Chriſt's baptizing in <hi>Judaea,</hi> though that be not far remov'd from his firſt ſetting up for Diſciples, becauſe whilſt <hi>John</hi> was yet<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3.22, 23.</note> baptizing, which is the time, from whence the Scripture<note n="(k)" place="margin">Act. 1.22. — 10.37.</note> makes our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's preaching to commence. Not that there are any expreſs proofs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time of his baptizing any Diſciples, but that it may be ſome probable proofs may offer themſelves for it, and ſuch as we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably refuſe. Of which nature I reckon firſt his making Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36048:30"/>that time, and particularly thoſe Diſciples, whom he made uſe of to baptize in the Land of <hi>Jury.</hi> For if our Saviour made Diſciples before, why not after the ſame manner, wherein he made thoſe of <hi>Judaea?</hi> He had to induce him to it the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that then prevail'd among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of making Diſciples by that ſolemnity, as appears both by their ſo admitting Proſelytes, and the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of his Forerunner. He had to induce him to it the greater likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood there was thereby of inviting others to the ſame Baptiſm, than if thoſe, who were the firſt, and chief, and moreover made uſe of by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to baptize, had not firſt been baptiz'd themſelves: Becauſe ſo there could have been no pretence to refuſe the Baptiſm he propos'd, whereas otherwiſe they might have rejected it as a thing unneceſſary to be had, or ſcrupled it as proceeding from incompetent Adminiſtrators of it. In fine, he had to induce him to it that, which prevail'd with himſelf<note n="(l)" place="margin">Matt. 3.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> to receive the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> even their <hi>fulfilling all righteouſneſs,</hi> who were not only the firſt of his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36048:30"/>Diſciples, but ordained by himſelf to be a pattern unto others. Which inducements as they are of no ſmall force to perſuade his baptizing from the beginning, becauſe but ſuitable to his own proceedings, or the common reaſonings of Mankind; ſo will no doubt be accounted ſuch, if there be not equal probabilities to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as which are the only things, that can take off the edge of them. Now what is there of that nature, that can perſwade Chriſt's omiſſion of Baptiſm, unleſs it be either the Scripture's ſilence, which ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards conſidered, or his willingneſs thereby to intimate, that he had not ſo tied his own Graces to an external Rite, but that he could, and would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion conferr them without it? But beſide that there was a like fear thereby of Men's neglecting his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments upon a preſumption of their receiving his Graces as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did; This may ſeem to have been too early a ſeaſon for ſuch an intimation, becauſe before Men were well confirm'd in his Authority, or ability to conferr them, even by the ordinary ſolemnities. For if they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36048:31"/>were not as yet well confirm'd in that, how ſhould they dream of a greater power, yea not rather be thereby tempted to queſtion altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Authority, becauſe depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far even from the example of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> whom all Men<note n="(m)" place="margin">Matt. 21.26.</note> 
                  <hi>accounted as a Prophet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſide that our Saviour made Diſciples before, and may therefore not improbably be thought to have made them after the ſame manner; We find yet farther, that before he baptiz'd thoſe of <hi>Judaea,</hi> he repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſolemnity of Baptiſm as a thing neceſſary to enter Men into that Kingdom of God, to which he invited them: Our Saviour not only telling <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that <hi>except a Man were born again</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Joh. 3.3,</note>, <hi>he could not ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> but yet more plainly, that <hi>except he were born again of Water</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note>, <hi>and of the Spirit, he could not poſſibly enter into it.</hi> For how could Chriſt repreſent that as neceſſary, which be himſelf had not afforded to his firſt, and chiefeſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, nor, for ought that doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ever after did? For if he did, he would certainty have done it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36048:31"/>he made uſe of them to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize others; Partly becauſe they were the firſt Diſciples he had, and partly becauſe ſo they would have been more apparently qualified to have adminiſtred the ſame Baptiſm unto others. If therefore Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented Baptiſm as neceſſary, even before his baptizing in <hi>Judaea,</hi> it is not unreaſonable to think he had both inſtituted, and adminiſtred it before: Eſpecially, when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he before had cannot well be thought to have had it afterwards, as in reaſon they muſt have had it, if it were ſo neceſſary as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our affirm'd it. And poſſibly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they, who are otherwiſe perſwaded, have in the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the force of this argument, had it not been for an opinion of theirs, that our Saviour ſpake not in this place of Baptiſm, but of Men's being born again of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which hath the ſame cleanſing quality with water: So making that ſpeech of our Saviour to be that, which the <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> call an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and conſequently reſolvable into a <hi>watery,</hi> or <hi>cleanſing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36048:32"/>Spirit,</hi> as Virgil<hi>'s pateris libamus &amp; auro,</hi> is into <hi>pateris aureis,</hi> or <hi>golden Diſhes.</hi> Even as they ſuppoſe the Scripture<note n="(p)" place="margin">Matt. 3.11.</note> meant when it affirm'd, that Chriſt ſhould baptize <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> that is to ſay, with that Holy Ghoſt, which hath the <hi>purifying,</hi> and <hi>warming</hi> qualities of that Element. I will not now ſay, though I might, that that <hi>figure</hi> might have been more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable here, if that ſpeech of Chriſt could have been ſo fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd into a <hi>watery Spirit,</hi> as <hi>pateris &amp; auro</hi> may be into <hi>pateris aureis;</hi> Which that it cannot be is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evident from Gold's being the proper Material of thoſe Diſhes, whereof the Poet ſpeaks, which <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to be ſure is not of the other. But neither will I any more than ſay, that Chriſt's baptizing <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire</hi> doth not make at all for this <hi>figure,</hi> becauſe it is certain that at the day of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt,</hi> which was the moſt notorious deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly referr'd to by that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm<note n="(q)" place="margin">Act. 1.5.</note>, Chriſt baptized his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with a material fire, as well as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36048:32"/>that. But I ſay, which is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, that there is great reaſon to underſtand our Saviour <hi>here</hi> of <hi>that Baptiſm</hi> by water, which we have affirmed his words to import. For ſo firſt (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>

So ſecondly (as the ſame <hi>Hooker</hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36048:33"/>I reckon as none of the leaſt that, which gave occaſion to them, even <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s <hi>coming to Jeſus by night</hi>
                  <note n="(u)" place="margin">Joh. 3.2.</note> and there, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging to him, that he was a <hi>teacher come from God,</hi> and that he himſelf was induced to believe it by the <hi>miracles</hi> our Saviour wrought For that <hi>ſecret</hi> confeſſion of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only not agreeable to that more publick one<note n="(w)" place="margin">Matt. 10.32.</note>, which our Saviour requir'd, but (as appears by the anſwer he return'd to it) intimated by him to be inſufficient, becauſe letting him know, that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he was born again of water, and the ſpirit,</hi> he could not enter into the Kingdom of God; Nothing can be more agreeable to our Saviour's mind, than to underſtand thoſe <hi>Words</hi> of his of Men's making a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick confeſſion of him in order to their Salvation, if the <hi>Words</hi> can with any reaſon be thought to admit of it. Which that they may is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, that, whatever our Saviour now underſtood by them, the like expreſſion<note n="(x)" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> became af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards an uſual <hi>periphraſis</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which was a publick confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36048:33"/>of our Saviour. I ſay ſecondly, that as the occaſion of the words doth naturally lead to ſuch a ſenſe, as will make them import a more publick Confeſſion of our Saviour; So it will conſequently prompt us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them of ſuch a new Birth, as is perform'd by Water, and the Spirit, rather than of that, which is perform'd by the Spirit alone: That, as it is a Birth, which manifeſts it ſelf to the Eyes of others, which this cannot be ſuppoſed to do, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Birth therefore, which may publickly declare our Confeſſion of him, by whoſe appointment we are born again. Agreeable hereto thirdly is the ſenſe of the words themſelves, if thoſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> of whom <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was ſometime a Ruler, may be liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to in this affair; They not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirming their own Proſelytes to have been admitted by Baptiſm, but that Baptiſm alſo repreſented as a thing, which gave them a new birth, yea ſo far, as to make them put off their old relations by it. For what then can be more reaſonable, than to think, that our Saviour, when he ſpake to a <hi>Jew,</hi> ſpake the ſame
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36048:34"/>Language with them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that, as he ſpake of being born of Water, as well as the Spirit, he meant a like Baptiſm by it. Eſpecially, when it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, fourthly, that our Saviour ask'd <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> not without ſome amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Joh. 3.20.</note>, <hi>Art thou a Maſter in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> For what was this, but to intimate yet more, that the new Birth, whereof he ſpake, was no ſtranger to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſequently, becauſe he ſpake of being born of Water, that he meant a Baptiſm by it? Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, fifthly, our Saviour's affirming himſelf in the former Diſcourſe to have ſpoken of <hi>earthly</hi>
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">Joh. 3.12.</note> things, and (as one would think) therefore of ſuch a Birth, which though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by God's Spirit, yet had ſomething of earthly, as that is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to heavenly, adhering to it: As, in fine, the Evangeliſt's ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Diſcourſe of a <hi>new Birth by Water</hi> the mention of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's<note n="(*)" place="margin">Joh. 3.22.</note> paſſing into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and <hi>there baptizing;</hi> There being not a fairer account either of that connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or our Saviour's proceedings,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36048:34"/>than that, agreeably to what he had ſaid concerning the neceſſity of Men's being <hi>ſo born again,</hi> he went into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and <hi>baptized,</hi> and ſo made way for their <hi>entrance into God</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Such evidence there is of our Saviour's meaning a proper Baptiſm, when he ſpake of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Men's being <hi>born again of water, and of the Spirit;</hi> And if our Saviour meant ſuch a Baptiſm, there is as little doubt of his having before both inſtituted, and adminiſtred it, yea even from the time of his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up for Diſciples; There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the leaſt appearance of Chriſt's baptizing thoſe firſt Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples afterwards, which yet he muſt have done, conſidering the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity thereof, if they had not been baptiz'd before.</p>
               <p>I will conclude what I have to ſay concerning the earlineſs of our Saviour's Baptiſm, when I have added from a paſſage of Chriſt to S. <hi>Peter</hi> the farther probability there is of <hi>his,</hi> and the <hi>other Apoſtles</hi> having receiv'd it, and therefore, if they did ſo, of their having receiv'd it from the beginning of their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſhip:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36048:35"/>That I mean, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s begging of Chriſt to <hi>waſh not only his feet, but his hands, and his head,</hi> if (as our Saviour had told him) <hi>he could have no part in him, unleſs he waſh'd him,</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to have made anſwer<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 13.10.</note>, that <hi>he, that had been waſh'd,</hi> even by a more general waſhing, <hi>needed not ſave to waſh his feet.</hi> For as our Saviour intimates by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that he, and the reſt had paſſed under the former waſhing, and conſequently did not need ſuch a general waſhing a ſecond time; ſo he may not improbably be thought to have meant the waſhing of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and which though in it ſelf an outward purification, yet was attended with an inward, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual one: Partly, becauſe it is certain that our Saviour had before this time made uſe of the Baptiſm of Water to purifie Men unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and may therefore be well enough ſuppoſed to allude unto it; And partly, becauſe that Baptiſm, or waſhing will be more directly oppoſed to that, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our intended, and which though
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36048:35"/>deſign'd by him to ſignifie a more ſpiritual purgation, even that of the affections, or actions, yet was performed by him by an outward waſhing. For why then ſhould we not think, that the Apoſtles had that more general waſhing of Baptiſm? Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we know that about this time Chriſt adminiſtred to them the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt, and which as it is in order of nature after that of Baptiſm, and may therefore not unreaſonably be thought to have been preceded by theirs, ſo is an evidence that Chriſt meant, in ſome meaſure at leaſt, to conduct them by the ſame Rites, and Ceremonies, wherewith he intended to bring other Men unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>One only thing there is, which can any way prejudice the former Diſcourſe, even the <hi>ſilence</hi> there is in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of any Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm by Chriſt before that in <hi>Judaea,</hi> yea the ſilence there is of it in that very <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> who takes ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of the other. And ſurely ſuch a ſilence would have been of no ſmall force, if it had been either a perfect ſilence, or an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36048:36"/>one. But as that ſtory cannot be look'd upon as perfectly ſilent, which affords ſo many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable proofs of what it is pretended to be ſilent in; ſo there may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough given of its aſcending no higher in its account of Chriſt's adminiſtration of Baptiſm, than that, which was performed by him in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea:</hi> Partly, becauſe the <hi>Author</hi> of it had before acquainted his Readers with Chriſt's repreſenting it as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally neceſſary<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> to Salvation, and from which, and the following pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Saviour in making Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Men might reaſonably enough collect his having ſo made the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ones; And partly becauſe he knew, that what was defective in his account of our Saviour's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, might be abundantly ſupplied to poſterity (to whom he, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evangeliſts principally wrote) by what thoſe other Evangeliſts<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.

               <p>Now there are four things to be enquir'd concerning the firſt of theſe, even the outward and viſible ſign of Baptiſm. Firſt, what that outward and viſible ſign is. Secondly, wherein it was intended as a ſign. Thirdly, how it ought to be applied. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is to be thought of thoſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36048:39"/>additions, which were anciently made, or continue as yet in being in the outward ſolemnities of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As touching the outward, and viſible ſign of Baptiſm, there is no doubt it is the Element of Water, as is evident from the native ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which ſignifies an <hi>immerſion,</hi> or <hi>dipping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome liquid thing,</hi> from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thoſe Baptiſms, which were in uſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which our Saviour (becauſe making uſe of the ſame <hi>word</hi> to expreſs his own Baptiſm by) is in reaſon to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have ſo far conform'd it to, but more eſpecially from the account we have of the Adminiſtration of it, both whilſt our Saviour continu'd here, and after his Aſcenſion into Heaven. For thus after S. <hi>John</hi> had ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3.22.</note>, that our Saviour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after his entring upon his Prophetick Office, came into the Land of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and there baptized, he immediately ſubjoyn'd<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3.23.</note>, that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt <hi>alſo was then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing in Aenon near to Salim, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was much water there.</hi> For
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36048:39"/>as it is evident from thence, as well as from other places<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 3.6. —13.</note>, that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>John</hi> was a Baptiſm by Water; ſo the Evangeliſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt as practiſing the ſame thing with our Saviour, ſhews the Baptiſm of our Saviour to have been ſo far like it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to have had Water for the Inſtrument thereof. The ſame is yet more evident as to the practice of our Saviour's Diſciples, after his more general Command<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> of Baptiſm, and his own Aſcenſion into Heaven. For thus we find <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch going down into a certain water</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Act. 8.38.</note>, by which they paſs'd in order to the Baptiſm of the latter; As that too, after the <hi>Eunuch</hi> had admoniſhed him<note n="(c)" place="margin">Act. 8.36.</note>, <hi>ſee here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized.</hi> And thus too we find S. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Act. 10.47, 48.</note>, before he gave order for <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his companies being <hi>baptized in the name of the Lord,</hi> demanding of thoſe of the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> that came with him, whether <hi>any Man could forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, which bad receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt, as well as themſelves;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36048:40"/>intimating, or rather expreſly declaring, that our Saviour's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was, as to the outward, and viſible ſign, the ſame with that of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and other the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Water therefore being no doubt the outward and viſible ſign of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and ſo declared to be by the manner of its Adminiſtration; The next thing to be enquir'd into is, wherein it was intended as a ſign, which will appear to have been in theſe three particulars: Firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that cleanſing quality, which is natural to it, ſecondly in reſpect of that uſe which it was put to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout new-born Infants, thirdly in reſpect of that manner of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, which was firſt us'd, and no doubt generally intended, I mean the dipping of the Party baptized in it.</p>
               <p>That the Water of Baptiſm was intended as a ſign in reſpect of the firſt of theſe, will need no other proof, than <hi>Ananias</hi>'s admoniſhing <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>ariſe and be baptized, and waſh</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Act. 22.16.</note> 
                  <hi>away his ſins,</hi> calling upon the name of the Lord. For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36048:40"/>on the one hand, that the Baptiſm, to which <hi>Paul</hi> was invited, even the Chriſtian one, was a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm by Water, and, on the other hand, that it was at leaſt ordained for the <hi>remiſſion</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> 
                  <hi>of ſins,</hi> and ſo the putting away their guilt; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more reaſonable, than to think, that when <hi>Ananias</hi> ſubjoyn'd to the precept of <hi>being baptiz'd</hi> that of <hi>waſhing away his ſins,</hi> he meant his waſhing them away by Baptiſm, and conſequently that the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was both a ſign of ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the putting away of his ſins, and a ſign too in particular in reſpect of that cleanſing quality, which is natural to it, becauſe that Baptiſm, to which it belongs, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd as <hi>waſhing</hi> away the other.</p>
               <p>But beſide that Water was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a ſign in reſpect of that cleanſing quality, which is natural to it; There is equal reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it was alſo intended as ſuch in reſpect of the uſe it was then put to about <hi>new-born Infants,</hi> even the waſhing away of thoſe impurities, which they contracted from the Womb.

For this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhews this <hi>ſecond</hi> Birth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>firſt,</hi> and conſequently, that the Element of Water, and the Regeneration by it, though borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more immediately from the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet was intended by our Saviour (as I no way doubt it was alſo by the <hi>Jews</hi>) as of like uſe with that, which was apply'd to new-born Infants, and to repreſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like waſhing away of natural pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>One other particular there is, wherein I have ſaid the Water of Baptiſm to have been intended as a ſign, and that is in reſpect of that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36048:42"/>
                  <hi>manner</hi> of application, which was ſometime us'd, I mean the <hi>dipping,</hi> or <hi>plunging</hi> the party baptized in it. A ſignification, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> will not ſuffer thoſe to forget, who have been acquainted with his Epiſtles. For with reference to that manner of Baptizing we find him affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note n="(m)" place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note>, that we are <hi>buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life;</hi> And again<note n="(n)" place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note>, that <hi>if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection.</hi> To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or rather yet more clearly, doth that Apoſtle diſcourſe, where he tells us<note n="(o)" place="margin">Col. 2.12.</note>, that as we are <hi>buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſt in Baptiſm, ſo we do therein riſe alſo with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi> For what is this but to ſay, that as the deſign of Baptiſm was to oblige Men to conform ſo far to Chriſt's Death, and Reſurrection, as to die unto Sin, and live again unto Righteouſneſs, ſo it was perform'd by the ceremony of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36048:42"/>immerſion, that the perſon immersd might by that very ceremony, which was no obſcure image of a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be minded of the preceden death, as in like manner, by his comming again out of the Water, of his riſing from that death to life, after the example of the Inſtituter thereof? For which cauſe, as hath been elſewhere<note n="(p)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed, in the words, <hi>Aud Buried.</hi>
                  </note> obſerv'd, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church added to the Rite of immerſion the dipping of the party three ſeveral times to repreſent the three days Chriſt continued in the Grave (for that we find to have been the intention of ſome) and made the <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Eaſter</hi> one of the ſolemn times of the Adminiſtration of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing to be enquir'd concerning the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm is, how it ought to be apply'd, where again theſe two things would be conſidered. Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ought to be applyed by an immerſion, or by that, or an aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or effuſion. Secondly, whether it ought to be applyed by a threefold immerſion, or aſperſion, anſwerably to the names into which we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, or either by that, or a ſingle one.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:36048:43"/>
               <p> The former of theſe is, it may be, a more material queſtion, than it is commonly deem'd by us, who have been accuſtomed to baptize by a bare effuſion, or ſprinkling of water upon the party. For in things, which depend for their force, upon the meer will, and pleaſure of him, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted them, there ought, no doubt, great regard to be had to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of him, who did ſo; As without which there is no reaſon to preſume, we ſhall receive the benefit of that ceremony, to which he hath been pleaſed to annex it. Now, what the command of Chriſt was in this particular, cannot well be doubted of by thoſe who ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der firſt the words of Chriſt<note n="(q)" place="margin">Matt. 28.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>9.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and the practice of thoſe times, whether in the Baptiſm <hi>of John,</hi> or of <hi>our Saviour.</hi> For the words of Chriſt are, that they ſhould. <hi>Baptize,</hi> or <hi>Dip</hi> thoſe, whom they made Diſciples to him (for ſo, no doubt, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly ſignifies) and, which is more, and not without its weight, that they ſhould baptize them <hi>into</hi> the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36048:43"/>of the Holy Ghoſt: Thereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating ſuch a waſhing, as ſhould receive the party baptized within the very body of that Water, which they were to baptize him with. Though, if there could be any doubt concerning the ſignification of the words in themſelves, yet would that doubt be remov'd by conſidering the practice of thoſe times, whether in the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> or of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. For ſuch as was the practice of thoſe times in Baptizing, ſuch in reaſon are we to think our Saviour's command to have been concerning it, eſpecially, when the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves incline that way; There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not otherwiſe any means either for thoſe, or future times to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his intention concerning it. Now what the practice of thoſe times was as to this particular, will need no other proof than their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting to <hi>Rivers,</hi> and other ſuch like <hi>receptacles</hi> of waters for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that ceremony, as that too becauſe there was <hi>much Water</hi> there. For ſo the Scripture doth not only affirm concerning the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Matt. 3.5, 6.13. John 3.23.</note>, but both intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36048:44"/>that, which our Saviour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in <hi>Judaea</hi> (becauſe making <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, and <hi>his</hi> to be ſo far forth of the ſame ſort<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Joh. 3.22, 23.</note>) and expreſly affirm concerning the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> which is the only Chriſtian Baptiſm the Scripture is any thing particular in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of: The words of S. <hi>Luke</hi>
                  <note n="(t)" place="margin">Act. 8.38.</note> being, that both <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> went down into a certain wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they met with in their journey, in order to the baptizing of the latter. For what need would there have been either of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt's reſorting to great confluxes of Water, or of <hi>Philip,</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi>'s going down into this, were it not that the Baptiſm both of the one, and the other was to be performed by an immerſion? A very little Water, as we know it doth with us, ſufficing for an effuſion, or ſprinkling. But beſide the words of our Bleſſed Saviour, and the concurrent practice of thoſe times, wherein this Sacrament was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; It is in my opinion of no leſs conſideration, that the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, cannot otherwiſe be well repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36048:44"/>than by an immerſion, or at leaſt by ſome more general way of purification, than that of effuſion, or ſprinkling.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36048:47"/>in its kind, and, where it might be had, in thoſe circumſtances alſo, wherein it was inſtituted, yet ſince God had declar'd<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 12.7.</note>, That <hi>he would have mercy, and not ſacrifice,</hi> there was reaſon enough to believe, that he requir'd no farther a compliance in this particular, than was conſiſtent with the ſafety of Mens lives to afford; eſpecially, when what was wanting in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the outward viſible ſign might be made up by the form of words, wherewith it was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and Men admoniſhed thereby of thoſe ſignifications of Baptiſm, which the viſible ſolemnities thereof did not ſuggeſt. For, the ſeveral ends of Baptiſm being thus ſecur'd, there was ſtill the leſs reaſon to be ſcrupulous about the means, or think God would be rigorous in exacting them. But ſo they might be yet more aſſur'd (as it appears St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Ubi ſupra.</note> was) by what the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>

                  </note> ſo applying this, and the like paſſages; So we cannot therefore better interpret the <hi>ſprinkling of clean Water</hi> upon them in order to it, than of the Water of Baptiſm, and which the Spirit of God expreſſing by the term of <hi>ſprinkling of</hi> Water ſhews it to have foreſeen a neceſſity of its being ſo adminiſtred often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and his own allowance of it. All which things whoſoever ſhall conſider, will, I doubt not, ſee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to think, that neceſſity may juſtifie an <hi>Aſperſion</hi> in Baptiſm, and nothing more therefore left to enquire upon this Head, than what may be look'd upon as ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which will bring the queſtion yet nearer to our ſelves. Now as there can be no doubt of <hi>ſickneſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36048:48"/>ſuch, and particularly ſuch a ſickneſs, as faſtens Men to their <hi>Beds;</hi> So we ſhall therefore have nothing more to conſider of, than the caſe of <hi>Infants,</hi> and to whom as Baptiſm is generally adminiſtred, ſo it is alſo perform'd by an effuſion, or ſprinkling. With what neceſſity, is the thing we are to enquire, and ſo much the rather becauſe the <hi>Greek</hi> Church uſeth immerſion, or dipping to this very day, and the <hi>Muſcovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Church after its example. For if the coldneſs of any Clime may be thought to make that Rite dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſuch tender Bodies, one would think they of the <hi>latter</hi> ſhould find it to be ſuch, and therefore ſee a neceſſity of changing it. For the clearing whereof we are to know, that as they, who uſe the Rite of immerſion, even in warmer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, are ſo ſenſible of the tenderneſs of Infant Bodies, that they make uſe of warm Water to baptize them; So the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> making uſe of it without any danger (if yet they always do ſo) will not make it ceaſe to be ſuch to Infants of other Countries: There being, as every
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36048:49"/>one knows, no ſmall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bodies of Infants, as well as thoſe of Men, and to ſome of whom therefore, and in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that may be exceeding dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, which Infants of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries find no ſuch inconvenience by. And indeed as ſuch an Immerſion of Infants, eſpecially in theſe Northern parts, cannot generally be thought to be without its hazard, how warily and carefully ſoever managed; As it may be yet more hazardous to weaker Infants, and whom, as it would not be thought fit to deny Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to, ſo as little, to do any thing to ſend them out of the World; ſo I am apt to believe upon ſecond thoughts (for I have <hi>elſewhere</hi>

For, not to mention any other proofs, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who flouriſhed within an hundred years after the laſt of the Apoſtles, doth not only mention the threefold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion, as a thing in uſe in his time, but as a thing which was derived to them from<note n="*" place="margin">Tert. de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronâ, c. <hi>3.</hi> Ergo quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus, an &amp; Traditio niſi ſcripta non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat recipi.

Which they thought they might moſt aſſuredly do, if
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36048:52"/>they made uſe of ſuch farther Rites, as did repreſent yet more to their ſenſes what that Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to declare. And indeed, as that way of Inſtruction was in part warranted by the Sacraments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe profeſſing by ſenſible things to teach Men Spiritual ones; As it became yet more neceſſary by the groſneſs of the Vulgar ſort, and that infinity of Ceremonies, to which they had been before accuſtomed: So that, which afterwards made them faulty, was either the exceeding <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> thereof (and which experience aſſures us doth rather obſcure, yea overwhelm the thing ſignified by them, than help toward the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it) or their advancing by degrees into the ſame repute, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity with the ſigns of Chriſt's own Inſtitution. Which is ſo true, that they came in fine to be repreſented, as means, and conveyers of Grace, as well as ſignificative thereof; Thereby making them Sacraments, rather than appendages of ſuch; and which whoſoever goes about to do, muſt neceſſarily uſurp the place of God, and Chriſt, as to whom alone
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36048:52"/>it doth belong (becauſe the only givers of Spiritual Graces) to make any ceremony the conveyer of them. But as that Church, whoſe Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm I explain, hath been ſo far from multiplying Rites in Baptiſm, that ſhe hath contented her ſelf with one ſingle one, even the Sign of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> So ſhe hath ſo explain'd her own meaning in it, both in that form of word<note n="(g)" place="margin">In the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Bapt.</note>, wherewith ſhe appointeth it to be made, and in a Canon<note n="(h)" place="margin">Can. 30.</note> deviſed expreſly for that purpoſe, that it will not be eaſie for conſiderate Men to believe, that ſhe repreſents it as a Sacrament, or indeed that ſhe may not require the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of her Children to it.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36048:53"/>which are brought againſt this Ceremony, and which therefore it will be neceſſary to conſider; Its being a Ceremony, and ſo leſs agreeable to a ſpiritual, and ſubſtantial Religion; Its being an addition to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, and therefore imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething of imperfection in that; As laſtly, its being a relique of Popery, or giving too much counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the errors of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is certainly one of the moſt unreaſonable charges, that were ever advanced againſt our Church by the Adverſaries thereof. As will appear if we conſider the nature of thoſe, for whoſe edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, and the like Ceremonies were intended, The uſe ſuch things are of to procure reſpect to thoſe Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to which they are annexed, And the nature of that Religion, with whoſe Offices they are intermixed.</p>
               <p>That I alledge as one ground of this, and the like Ceremonies the very nature of thoſe Men, for whoſe edification they were intended, is their being compoſed of Fleſh, as well as Spirit, and conſequently the need they ſtand in of ſuch ſenſible helps
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36048:53"/>to awaken their underſtandings to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and their affections to embrace what they were deſigned to repreſent. For being ſo fram'd, it is not eaſie to believe, that, if there were not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in all actions of moment to affect Men's ſenſe, they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them as they ought, or be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with them. Of which yet if any doubt be made, we have the conſtant practice of the World to juſtifie it, becauſe rarely, if ever, ſuffering that, which was ſuch (though there wanted not words to expreſs their meaning) to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome viſible ſolemnities. Thus, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Eccl. Pol. li. 4. §. 1.</note> did long ſince ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>Abraham</hi> proceeded with his Servant, becauſe not only obliging him to take a Wife for his Son out of his Kindred, but to accompany that <hi>Oath</hi> of his, with the putting of his Hand<note n="(k)" place="margin">Gen. 24.2-9.</note> under his Maſter's Thigh. And thus too <hi>Iſrael</hi> made <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ſwear<note n="(l)" place="margin">—47.29.</note>, that he would not bury him in <hi>Egypt:</hi> Both of them, as is not unlikely, from ſome recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cuſtom of that time, becauſe as they ſay<note n="(m)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vatabl.</hi> in Gen. 24.2.</note>, yet obſerved in ſome of the Eaſtern parts, and as a token
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36048:54"/>of the homage the Party ſwearing ow'd to thoſe to whom they ſwore, and of their readineſs to execute it in the thing ſworn to by them. In like manner, as the ſame Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi ſupra.</note> hath alſo obſerv'd, it was an <hi>Ancient manner in Iſrael concerning redeeming, and exchanging</hi> for the Man, who refus'd to redeem, to <hi>pluck off his Shoe,</hi> and<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ruth 4.7.</note> give it to him, that would; As among the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they made any Man <hi>Free,</hi> not only to declare before the Magiſtrate, that they intended to make him ſuch, but to ſtrike him on the Cheek, to turn him round, and have his Hair ſhav'd off, the Magiſtrate, after that, touching him with a White Rod, and beſtowing a Cap, and a White Garment on him. Of which, and infinite other inſtances, that might be produced, what account can be given, but that Men have generally thought ſuch ſolemnities but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to imprint the things, to which they were annexed, upon the minds of thoſe, that were concern'd, and procure a due eſtimate thereof? But ſo it appears, that they themſelves were in a great meaſure perſwaded,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36048:54"/>who ſhew'd themſelves the greateſt Enemies of the Ceremonies of the Church; Becauſe obliging thoſe, that took their <hi>ſolemn League, and Covenant,</hi> to ſwear to the Contents thereof with their <hi>hands lift up to the moſt High God,</hi> as is expreſſed in the very entrance of it. For why that Ceremony of <hi>lifting up of the hands,</hi> eſpecially in a <hi>Covenant,</hi> that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to beat down the ſuppoſed ſuperſtition of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> were it not that they themſelves found it in a manner neceſſary to awaken the minds of Men to intend the Religion of it?</p>
               <p>But beſide that humane nature doth, by the very contexture of it, require ſuch kind of ſolemnities to awaken their minds, and affections; It is not a little to be conſidered <hi>of what uſe they are to procure reſpect to thoſe Inſtitutions, to which they have been at any time annexed.</hi> For may not Men obſerve that uſefulneſs in the ſolemnities of all <hi>civil affairs,</hi> and particularly in thoſe ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are obſerv'd in <hi>Courts of Judicature?</hi> Doth not the very <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing high</hi> of thoſe <hi>Benches,</hi> on which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36048:55"/>the Judges ſit, admoniſh Men of their Superiority over them? Do not thoſe Robes, whereby they are differenced from other Men, draw the Eyes of the Vulgar to them, yea mind them of that greater difference there is between the Judges, and themſelves, as to that power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are alſo inveſted? Have not the ſame perſons therefore (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever clamour hath been rais'd againſt things of that nature) kept up them, and the like ſolemnities among them? Have they not done it in thoſe very inſtances, which have been ſcrupled at in the Church? For how ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious a thing in a Biſhop, or other Clergy Man hath the uſe of that Cap been, which theſe earthly Gods the Judges, and when they are about their great Maſter's work, do not only not ſcruple at, but diligently retain? As knowing, that ſuch <hi>marks of diſtinction</hi> do naturally lead Men to conſider thoſe perſons, or things, to which they are apply'd, as of a peculiar nature, and accordingly, if they deſerve it, to reſpect them. And if ſuch be the uſefulneſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſolemnities in other matters,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36048:55"/>why ſhould they be excluded from our Religion? Nay, why ſhould they not (conſidering the momentouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof) be rather applied to it?</p>
               <p>Eſpecially if we conſider thirdly <hi>the nature of that Religion,</hi> with whoſe Offices they are intermixed by us. For though that do more peculiarly call us to the intending of ſpiritual things; Though it do loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaim the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not obſcurely condemn the ſubſtituting of any the like burdenſome one: Yet as it no where condemns ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ceremonies, as may ſerve the better to lead Men to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and regard of ſpiritual things, ſo it gives a ſufficient countenance to them by the Sacraments I am now upon, and by thoſe other uſances, which were in vogue with the firſt Profeſſors of it. For how can that Religion be look'd upon as an enemy to Ceremonies, which requires Men to be initiated into it by the <hi>water, and immerſion of Baptiſm?</hi> Yea to keep up their intereſt in it by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the <hi>Bread, and Wine of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36048:56"/>Euchariſt,</hi> thoſe ſigns of our Saviour's Crucified Body, and of the ſpiritual benefits we reap by it? And though we do not find that our Saviour inſtituted any other Ceremonies, or at leaſt not with a deſign of giving them the ſame laſting obligation; Yet as we find our Saviour giving command to his Diſciples, when he firſt ſent them out to Preach, <hi>to ſhake off the duſt of their Feet</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Mark 6.11.</note> againſt thoſe that would not hear them, as a teſtimony of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God's word, and of their own reſolution not to have to do with them in the like kind which was a kind of Excommunication of them; So we find that <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (though under no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the former command, becauſe but a temporary one) <hi>ſhook off the duſt of their feet</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Acts 13.51.</note> againſt thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that rejected, and expelled them, as the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> after that, when the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> oppoſed themſelves, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phem'd, <hi>ſhaking his raiment</hi> at them<note n="(r)" place="margin">—18.6.</note> as a teſtimony of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them, in like manner, and leaving them to go unto the Gentiles.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36048:56"/>For what was this but to declare by a ſignificant Ceremony, that as they had rejected the Counſel of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward themſelves, ſo God had reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them in like manner, neither would that his Miniſters ſhould make the like propoſals to them? The ſame is yet more to be ſaid upon the account of <hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi> and which, though from no Command of Chriſt, was either uſed, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Apoſtles themſelves, both in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of Miniſters<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note>, and <hi>receiving penitent</hi> Sinners to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution<note n="(t)" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note>, and pardon. For theſe being noted Acts of that Religion, which we profeſs, and yet by the allowance of the Apoſtles themſelves tranſacted by the Ceremony of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands, make it evident, that our Religion doth rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, than reject ſuch viſible ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, where they are ſparingly, and diſcreetly apply'd.</p>
               <p>That firſt charge againſt the ſign of the Croſs being thus wip'd off, even that which pretends to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card it upon the account of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Ceremony; Let us ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be likely to ſuffer any more by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36048:57"/>the pretence of its being <hi>an addition of Men to the Inſtitution of Chriſt,</hi> yea to one, <hi>that is not without viſible ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his own appointment:</hi> Such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions ſeeming to imply the <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of that, to which they are made, and which there is the leſs reaſon to believe in the preſent affair, becauſe care hath been taken by our Saviour as to the outward form of its Adminiſtration, as well as to more material things. And ſurely ſo ſuch <hi>Additions</hi> might very well be thought to do, if either they were repreſented as of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Sacrament, or our Saviour had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to <hi>preſcribe,</hi> or direct the <hi>whole form</hi> of the Adminiſtration of it. But as it is notorious enough, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not repreſent the ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> as pertaining to the Eſſence of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe adminiſtring it after Baptiſm firſt given, yea after the mention of the Miniſter's <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> the baptized perſon into the <hi>Congregation of Chriſt's flock;</hi> So our Saviour is ſo far from preſcribing the whole external form of its Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that he hath left us to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36048:57"/>general tenour of his Doctrine, and the directions of our own reaſon, even for thoſe things that are more material, yea for ſuch as are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<note n="(u)" place="margin">See the Directory in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſm.</note> by thoſe very Men, who cry out againſt us for adding to Chriſt's Inſtitution. For where, I beſeech you, is there any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of other words concerning Baptiſm, than what is imply'd in that ſhort belief, into which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to Baptize? Where to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all, that are preſent, to look back to their own Baptiſm, and to repent of the violations of the Covenant they made with God in it? Where any directions for requiring the Parent of the Child to bring him up in the nurture of the Lord, yea to require the Parents ſolemn promiſe for the performance of it? Nay where, which is of all others the moſt material, any Prayer to Almighty God for the ſanctifying of the Water he is going to make uſe of, and which I no way doubt is neceſſary to the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it? All, that the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Baptiſm repreſents to us, being the baptizing thoſe, that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36048:58"/>and of the Son, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Now if our Saviour hath not profeſſed to preſcribe, even as to the things before directed, but left Men to the general conduct of his Doctrine, and the guidance of their own reaſon; What appearance is there as to his preſcribing after what external form, and order, all theſe things were to be done, and which if he hath not, there is no doubt the Governours of the Church may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as they ſhall ſee fit, yea do ſo without any fear of being thought to charge his Inſtitutions with imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? They being not to be thought to do ſo, who preſcribe rules concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things, which the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt profeſs not to give per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect directions in. The only thing, which hath occaſion'd Men's miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions firſt, and then their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo ſevere a Cenſure upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane preſcriptions in this kind, is an haſty opinion they have taken up of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being as particular in direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the external management of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Duties, as <hi>Moſes</hi> appears to have been as to the ſervices of the Law. For which yet they have had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36048:58"/>pretence, than a miſapplied Text of the <hi>Author to the Hebrews</hi>
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Heb. 3.2.</note>, even <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being as <hi>faithful in that houſe of God,</hi> which was committed to his charge, as <hi>Moſes was in his.</hi> But beſide that there appear not any ſuch particular directions from God to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and our Saviour therefore not to be look'd upon as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, for not reaching out ſuch particular directions to us; Beſides that, if our Saviour did not furniſh ſuch particular directions, yet he hath furniſhed his Church with a far greater portion of his Spirit, and which may ſerve to it as a guide to fit thoſe Services for its reſpective members; Beſide laſtly that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he enjoyn'd, becauſe to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed among people of ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and humours, were not capable, as to circumſtances, of ſuch ſtrict li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations, as that, which was to be exerciſed in one ſingle Nation only: There is nothing more evident to thoſe, that read the Scriptures, than that Chriſt hath given no ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions, and all Arguments from Chriſt's <hi>fidelity</hi> therefore of no
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36048:59"/>more avail in this affair, than thoſe, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are wont to draw from the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs of God,</hi> toward the proving of an <hi>Infallible</hi> Guide. For as no wiſe Man will be perſwaded by ſuch Arguments againſt the Teſtimony of his own ſenſes, which aſſure him of the errours of thoſe, whom they would have to be Infallible; So no conſidering Man will be perſwaded by the other into a belief of thoſe particular directions, which are not any where to be ſeen, nor which they themſelves, who maintain thoſe directions, have yet been able to ſhew. For when they have ſaid all they can toward the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of their Concluſion, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt they are able to prove is, that Chriſt hath given ſome general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections concerning the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religious Offices, and which as it doth not prejudge the giving of more particular ones, ſo doth much leſs make them to reflect any imperfection upon the Inſtitution of Chriſt, becauſe pretending not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it ſelf about them.</p>
               <p>One other Charge there is, which is more peculiar to the ſign of the

But as they, who advance the former of theſe, make <hi>Popery</hi> much more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, than it is for the advantage of <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> to allow; It being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from <hi>Tertullian</hi>

                  <hi>from his Birth.</hi> I call it laſtly ſuch a Corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, whereby it is <hi>averſe from every thing, that is good, and inclin'd to every thing, that is evil.</hi> Which I do upon the account of the Scripture's repreſenting it as a <hi>ſinful</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Pſa. 51.5.</note> one, and which, as ſuch, will make thoſe in whom it is, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from good,</hi> as well as <hi>inclinable to evil,</hi> yea averſe from <hi>all,</hi> that is good, and inclinable to <hi>all</hi> evil: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe good, yea all good is oppoſite
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36048:63"/>to ſuch an eſtate, and evil, yea all evil connatural to it. If they, in whom that corruption of nature doth as yet abide, be not always actually prevail'd upon to reject that good, from which we have affirm'd them to be ſo averſe, or to purſue that evil, to which we have affirm'd them to be inclinable, it is not becauſe they want any averſeneſs for the one, or inclination to the other, but for ſome other collateral conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations: Such as is, for example, the reputation, or advantage, that may accrue to them from the eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of any thing, that is good, or the omiſſion of any thing, that is evil For all good, and all evil being of one uniform nature, becauſe becoming good or evil by the conformity they bear to the divine Laws, or by their deviation from them; where there is an inclination to any thing that is good, there muſt be an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to all, that is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as on the other ſide where an averſeneſs from any thing, that is evil, an averſeneſs for all that, which is alike a tranſgreſſion of the Divine Laws. But as therefore nothing can
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36048:63"/>hinder us from repreſenting natural corruption as making Men averſe from all that is good, and inclinable to every thing that is evil; So neither can any thing oblige us to extend the force of it ſo far, as to make it to determine them in all their actions, and accordingly to carry them to an actual rejection of all, that is good, or a purſuance of all, that is evil; Partly becauſe Men may, and often do act contrary to their natural aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or inclinations, where there is hope of temporal advantage, or fear of any temporal evil; And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe we do not only find few natural Men proceeding to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Impiety, but find alſo great variety among them in the omiſſion of good Actions, or the commiſſion of thoſe that are evil. Of which variety what account could be given, when the Corruption of Nature is, and muſt be equal, becauſe all Men were alike in, and are alike deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> were it not that even that Corruption leaves place for the performance of many good, and the avoiding of many things, that are evil? For to aſcribe that variety ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36048:64"/>wholly, or principally to the different degrees of God's reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, is not only to ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Authority, that I know of, but to take away all diverſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the evil demerits of natural Men, and, together therewith, all different degrees of puniſhment; yea to make the Corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the only proper ground of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. For as, if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God's reſtraining Grace to take off natural Men from falling into the worſt of ſins, the greateſt actual ſinner cannot deſerve more puniſhment, than he who offends in a far leſs degree; Becauſe all demerit ariſeth from the pravity of the will, which is not more or leſs for the meer abſence, or preſence of God's reſtraining Grace: So the greateſt actual ſinner cannot become obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to puniſhment upon the ſcore of any other Corruption than that of Nature; That as it makes all his actual ſins to be neceſſary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reaſon to bear the whole blame, and puniſhment, ſo receiving no new aggravation from the want of that reſtraining Grace, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36048:64"/>might have withheld the party from them, in as much as that want (if it be a fault) is no leſs the reſult of his natural corruption, than his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al offences are. But therefore alſo as we cannot look upon natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as determining Men to all their actual errours, without taking away all diverſity between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits of natural Men, yea making natural Corruption the only proper ground of their puniſhment; ſo they, who do ſo, will be found to contradict the declarations of the Scripture, as well as the allowed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the World. For why, if there be no difference between the deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of natural Men, ſhould thoſe, that are in Authority, mete out different puniſhments to them according to the different degrees, or kinds of thoſe offences, which they commit? Nay, why ſhould the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it ſhall be <hi>more tolerable</hi> for ſome ſinners<note n="(b)" place="margin">Matt. 11.22, 24.</note>, than for others at the great day of judgment? That, as it is a judgment of righteouſneſs, ſo being conſequently to mete out equal puniſhments to all ſinners, if there be but an equality in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36048:65"/>Again, if natural Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be upon the matter the only proper ground of puniſhment, as it muſt of neceſſity be, if it be the unavoidable cauſe of actual ſins; How comes the Scripture to declare, that God will <hi>reward every Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi> to his works<note n="(c)" place="margin">Rom. 2.6.</note>, yea the wicked<note n="(d)" place="margin">Rom. 2.8.</note> according to his works, as well as the righteous according to theirs? For if natural Corruption be the only proper ground of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the works of Men <hi>in proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Speech</hi> can have no concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, and much leſs (as the Scripture declares) be the principal object of judgment, and therefore of that puniſhment, which it ſhall award. The utmoſt in my opinion, that can be ſaid in this particular, is that as Men by the Corruption of their Nature are averſe from every thing, that is good, ſo that averſeneſs will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe thoſe, in whom that Corruption abides, to all good actions whatſoever, and infallibly take them off from them, where either ſome work of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their minds doth not thruſt them on to them, or the comelineſs, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs thereof ſhall not more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36048:65"/>ſtrongly impel them to the practice of them. The <hi>former</hi> whereof will make the conſent of ſuch perſons even to thoſe good actions, which they perform, incomplete, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and indeed a conſent to them rather as expedient, than good; whence it is that our Church<note n="(e)" place="margin">Art. 13.</note> repreſents them as <hi>having the nature of ſins:</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> cauſe them to neglect all ſuch, as are not in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thruſt upon them by God, or have not one of the former motives to incite them to the practice of them, yea preſent to their minds, when they ought to make uſe of them. Which will occaſion ſuch perſons for the moſt part to neglect all good actions, where there is not place for ſerious thoughts, as in caſes of ſurpriſe, or where they have not been habituated to the practice of vertue, or to the conſideration of the comelineſs or profitableneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But as where there is place for ſerious thoughts, there may be place alſo for the former motives to impel Men to the practice of that, from which they are otherwiſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently averſe; So it is not unlikely
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36048:66"/>that the minds of thoſe, who have been before habituated to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, or contemplation of Vertue, may be thruſt on by the former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to purſue many things, that are good, yea acquit themſelves ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in them. Of which yet if any doubt be made, we have the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of ſeveral Heathens to convince us thereof, and who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Heathen, cannot be ſuppoſed to be free from the power of natural Corruption, or to be thruſt on by other motives, than the former, to the doing of ſuch actions, from which they are naturally ſo averſe. In like manner, As Men by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Nature are inclin'd to every thing that is evil, as well as averſe from every thing that is good; So that inclination will diſpoſe thoſe, in whom it is, to an allowance of all evil actions, and infallibly betray them, into them, where God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Grace doth not withhold them, or the indecency, or dangerous conſequences of the other do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like keep them back. The <hi>former</hi> whereof will make their abſtaining even from thoſe evil actions, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36048:66"/>they avoid, to be but an imperfect abſtinence from them, and indeed an abſtinence from them rather as inexpedient, than evil; The <hi>latter</hi> cauſe them to fall into all ſuch, from which they are not reſtrain'd by God, or by a preſent, and intenſe conſideration of the indecency, or danger of them. Which will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuch perſons for the moſt part to fall into all evil actions, where there is not room for ſerious thoughts, as in caſes of ſurpriſe, or where they have not been habituated to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of vice, or the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the indecency, or dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof. But as, where there is room for ſerious thoughts, there may alſo be place for the former reaſons to take them off from the practice of that, to which they are otherwiſe ſufficiently inclin'd; So it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that the minds of thoſe, who have been before habituated to the avoiding of Vice, or the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the indecency, or dangerouſneſs thereof, may be taken off by the former reaſons from the purſuit of evil things, yea acquit themſelves
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36048:67"/>ſingularly in it. As is farther evident from the reſiſtance, that hath been made by ſeveral Heathens to all the temptations of ſin, and who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Heathen, cannot be ſuppos'd either to have been free from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Corruption, or to have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by other means, than the former, from the doing of thoſe evil actions, to which they were ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclin'd.</p>
               <p>But becauſe what we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaid concerning the Corruption of our Nature doth rather tend to ſhew <hi>what effects</hi> it hath upon us, than what that Corruption is; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>word,</hi> whereby we have choſen to expreſs it, is but a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical</hi> one, and will therefore ſerve yet leſs clearly to declare the thing intended by it; Therefore it may ſeem but reaſonable to enquire yet farther, <hi>what</hi> it <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>wherein</hi> it doth <hi>conſiſt,</hi> as without which we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe but imperfectly concerning it Now as that queſtion cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be ſolv'd, than by the knowledge of that <hi>Eſtate,</hi> of which it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to be a Corruption; So I ſhall
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36048:67"/>therefore enquire again what that <hi>Eſtate</hi> was, and then what <hi>relation</hi> this <hi>Corruption</hi> beareth to it. As touching that eſtate, wherein God did at firſt create our Nature, moſt certain it is firſt (for ſo <hi>Solomon</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Eccl. 7.29.</note> affirms it to be) that it was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> that is to ſay ſuch an eſtate as fitted Man for the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of all thoſe Laws, which God had obliged him to perform. That, as it is the moſt uſual ſignification of the <hi>word</hi> we render <hi>upright,</hi> and accordingly rendred by the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt <hi>right, and innocent</hi> before God, ſo beſt anſwering the account before given concerning the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of humane Nature, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe of the Female Sex. For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking in the <hi>26th</hi> verſe of the deceitfulneſs of that Sex, and of the influence that deceitfulneſs of theirs would have upon ſinful Men; Affirming afterwards becauſe repreſenting the event of his ſearch as contrary to the deſires of his Soul, that though he could <hi>find one Man among a thouſand</hi> of a better temper, yet he could not find <hi>One</hi> ſuch <hi>Woman</hi> among them all; He muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36048:68"/>when he comes to ſay that he found only that <hi>God made Man</hi> upright, be thought to mean ſuch an uprightneſs, as was oppoſite to that general depravation, whereof he before complain'd. There being therefore no doubt to be made that God created our Nature in a ſtate of <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> even in ſuch a one as fitted Man for the obedience of all thoſe Laws, which he was obliged to comply with; Enquire we in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place wherein that ſtate of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs conſiſted, but which we ſhall not find to be of ſo eaſie a reſolution, as the former: Becauſe there is ſome preſumption of its conſiſting in a right diſpoſition of our natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; And there is ſome preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its conſiſting in a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grace over-ruling, and directing thoſe natural faculties to thoſe pious purpoſes, for which they were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign'd. We have to perfuade the former of theſe the natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the underſtanding to diſcern the inviſible things of God by the things, which he hath made, and the natural propenſion of the Will to embrace that, which is good,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36048:68"/>and therefore alſo the chiefeſt good, where that is clearly apprehended, and where there is no depravation in the Will (as to be fure there was not at firſt) to draw it to leſſer ones. In fine, we have to perſwade it the power the ſuperiour faculties of the Soul have even now over the Inferiour ones, and which we may well believe in that ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to have been of ſufficient force to keep them within thoſe bounds, which God, and Nature had ſet them. This, I ſay, we have to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade that uprightneſs, wherein our firſt Parents were Created, to have conſiſted in a right diſpoſition of their natural faculties; And we are not without reaſon on the other hand to perſwade the ſame uprightneſs of Nature to have conſiſted in its being over-ruled, and directed by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace: Becauſe without ſuch a ſupernatural Grace our firſt Parents could not have come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, but by the knowledge of Created Beings, and the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof, and (what that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge would have produc'd) a love, and affection for them. Which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36048:69"/>would not only have made God to be lov'd after his Creatures, who as being the firſt, and chiefeſt good ought to have the precedency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but endangered alſo the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our affections to him by the prepoſſeſſion of them by the other. To which of theſe two reaſonings to give the preeminency is hard to ſay, and I will not therefore be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſitive in determining concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of them, nor therefore, whether Original Righteouſneſs were a right diſpoſition of our natural faculties, or a ſupernatural Grace over-ruling, and directing them. But as how equal ſoever thoſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may be in themſelves, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will hinder our inclining rather to the one, than the other, if the Scripture, which is the beſt judge of things of that nature, ſeem to favour ſuch an inclination; So I muſt needs ſay that the Scripture<note n="(g)" place="margin">Gen. 1.28, &amp;c. —2.15, &amp;c.</note> ſeems to favour thoſe reaſonings, which makes Original Righteouſneſs to be a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Grace: Becauſe not only repreſenting <hi>Adam</hi> as imbued from the very firſt with the knowledge of God, which yet he could not be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36048:69"/>without a revelation from him, but as moreover freely converſing with God, and receiving both Laws, and priviledges from him. For as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from thence, that God did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſhine upon his mind, and ſo far forth therefore influenced him by a ſupernatural Grace, ſo it is not unlikely that he, who ſo ſhone upon his mind, did as immediately influence his will, and affections, and ſo diſpoſe him to a compliance with thoſe Laws he impos'd upon him: That, as it was but agreeable to the immediate illumination of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anding, ſo becoming yet more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by the different inclinations of his Fleſh, and Spirit, and which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Supernatural Grace may ſeem but requiſite to bring to a due compliance with each other, and with thoſe Laws, which God had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon them both. And I ſhall only add, that if that uprightneſs, wherein our Nature was at firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, were no other than a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace, as is at leaſt highly probable from the former reaſonings, and the declarations of the Scripture; We ſhall need to aſſign no other
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36048:70"/>relation of that Corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereof we ſpeak, than that of a <hi>ſimple privation</hi> of the other. For if the deſires of the Fleſh could ſo far prevail even under a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Grace, as to carry our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the eating of that fruit, which God had ſo ſeverely forbidden them; The <hi>ſimple privation</hi> of that ſupernatural Grace may well ſuffice to give birth to all our evil inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and conſequently paſs for a ſufficient account of that Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Nature, whereby, as I ſaid before, we become inclinable to Evil, as well as averſe from Good and which what evidence we have of the <hi>being</hi> of, is in the next place to be enquir'd.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Now as we cannot certainly better inform our ſelves concerning the preſent ſtate of our Nature, than from him who, as he was the Author of it, ſo is intimately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it; So I will therefore begin with that account, which he hath given us of it, and which we ſhall find to bear an ample Teſtimony to that Corruption, whereof we ſpeak. For the evidencing whereof I will ſhew
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36048:70"/>Firſt, that it affirmeth all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to be under ſin, yea under a perpetual courſe of it. Secondly, that it affirmeth them to be ſo from the time they begin to be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to offend. Thirdly, that they are ſo from a principle bred in them, and derived to them from their birth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all Men are under ſin S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo fully declare, that we ſhall need no other Teſtimony than his to evince it; More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, where he affirmeth that <hi>both Jews and Gentiles</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Rom. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>are all under ſin;</hi> That though the <hi>former</hi> may ſeem of all others to have been moſt free from it, yet the Law<note n="(i)" place="margin">Rom. 19.</note> had not ſtuck to affirm, that <hi>ther was none</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Rom. 10, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>righteous,</hi> even among them, <hi>no not one;</hi> That <hi>there was none that underſtood, none that ſought after God;</hi> That they were <hi>all gone out of the way, they were altogether become unprofitable, that there was none, that did good, no not one;</hi> In fine, that <hi>all the World</hi> muſt thereby<note n="(l)" place="margin">Rom. 19.</note> be look'd upon as <hi>guilty before God,</hi> becauſe, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <note n="(m)" place="margin">Rom. 23.</note> ſpeaks, <hi>all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:36048:71"/>But ſo the ſame Scripture did long before declare, with an addition of all Men's being under a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual courſe of ſin, as well as in ſome meaſure tainted with it; It being not only the voice of God concerning that part of Mankind, that liv'd before the flood, that <hi>every imagination</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> 
                  <hi>of the thought of their heart was only evil continually,</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like intimated by him concerning that part, which was to follow, even to the end of the World. For affirming, as he doth<note n="(o)" place="margin">Gen. 8.21.</note>, that he would <hi>not any more drown the World,</hi> becauſe <hi>the imagination of Man's heart is evil from his youth,</hi> he both ſuppoſeth that Mankind would again give occaſion to it by their evil ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations (as without which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe there could be no occaſion for God's ſuſpending it) and that Mankind would do ſo alſo in every individual, and Generation of it: The <hi>former,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaks of the imaginations of Mankind in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and which are therefore to be extended to all the individuals of it; The <hi>latter,</hi> becauſe if any Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men were likely to be free from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36048:71"/>thoſe imaginations, there would <hi>ſo far forth</hi> have been no need of his declaring, that he would not drown the World, becauſe no ground for bringing it on the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But therefore, as we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe from the places before, recited, that the World always was, and will be under ſin, yea under a conſtant courſe of it; So we ſhall be yet more confirmed in it, if we compare the latter place with the former, as the likeneſs, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, will oblige us to do: There being not a more apt ſenſe of that latter Speech of God, than that he would not again drown the Earth, becauſe he knew the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Men would be as evil as they had before been, and he therefore, if he were diſpos'd to take that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to bring a flood often upon it, to the no profit of thoſe, that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, as well as to the defacing of the Earth it ſelf. Which will make the condition of Man to be ſo ſinful, that it cannot be otherwiſe, unleſs by ſome powerful means delivered from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſo alſo may we inferr from thence, which was the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36048:72"/>to be prov'd, that all Men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin from the time they begin to be in a capacity to offend: That, as it affirms <hi>the imagination of Men's heart to be evil,</hi> ſo to be evil <hi>from their Youth,</hi> and, as I ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think, from the time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be in a capacity to be guilty of it. Not that that Age, to which we are wont to give the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Youth,</hi> is the firſt wherein Mankind begins to be in a capacity to offend (for there is but too much evidence of that in the riper years of <hi>Childhood</hi>) but that we cannot well underſtand that Text of any other <hi>youthful Period,</hi> than that wherein Mankind begins to be in a capacity to reaſon, and conſequently alſo to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: Partly, becauſe the <hi>word</hi> we render <hi>Youth</hi> is ſometime us'd even for infancy<note n="(p)" place="margin">Judges 13.7. Exod. 2.6.</note>, and ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without manifeſt reaſon to be removed too far from it; But more eſpecially becauſe it is the manifeſt deſign of God in the place we ſpeak of to aggravate the evil of Men's imaginations from the earlineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that <hi>earlineſs</hi> therefore to be carried as high, as the capacity Men
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36048:72"/>are in to <hi>imagine evil</hi> will ſuffer the doing of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now as nothing therefore can be wanting toward the proof of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption, than that they, who are ſo univerſally, and ſo early under ſin, are ſo alſo from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle, and ſuch an inward principle too, as was derived to them from their birth; ſo we ſhall not it may be need any other proof of that, than their being ſo univerſally, and early under the other: The <hi>former</hi> of theſe perſwading Men's being under ſin from ſome inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>latter</hi> from ſuch an inward principle, as is deriv'd to them from their Birth. That I make Men's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo univerſally under ſin, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their being ſo from ſome inward principle, is becauſe as ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral an effect muſt be ſuppoſed to have ſome general Cauſe, ſo no external Cauſe, how general ſoever, can be ſuppoſed to produce it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of the other. As will appear if we conſider the force of <hi>example,</hi> and which as it is the moſt general, and the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al external Cauſe, that can be aſſign'd,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36048:73"/>ſo is that, into which they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Corruption of Nature, are wont to reſolve the univerſality of ſin. For neither firſt is even <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of ſo great force, as infallibly, and univerſally to draw Men to the imitation of it; For ſome Men are Vertuous, even when they have an ill example before them, and others as Vitious, where they have a good. Neither ſecondly hath it any force, but what it receives from Men's apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to imitate thoſe, with whom they converſe. Which as it will make it neceſſary for us to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to an inward principle, even for thoſe effects, which are produc'd by the mediation of example, ſo make our very aptneſs to imitate the evil examples of others, a branch of that inward principle, which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to be the cauſe of ſo univerſal an impiety. Only becauſe we are yet upon Scripture proofs, and which the more expreſs they are, ſo much the more convictive; Therefore I ſhall yet more particularly endeavour to evince from thence, that as all Men are under ſin, ſo they are ſo by an innate principle. But ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:36048:73"/>gives us clearly enough to underſtand, becauſe both aſſerting ſuch a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that all actual ſins are the iſſues of it: The <hi>former,</hi> where he repreſents even the Man, who was under the conviction of the <hi>Law</hi> (and who therefore might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be moſt free from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of ſin) as <hi>Carnal,</hi> yea <hi>ſold under it</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Rom. 7.14.</note>, as one, who had <hi>ſin dwelling in him</hi> (for ſo he affirms no leſs than twice<note n="(r)" place="margin">Rom. 17.20,</note>) and as one too, who had <hi>a law in his members</hi>
                  <note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Rom. 23,</note> 
                  <hi>that warred againſt the law of his mind,</hi> or (as he afterwards entitles it) <hi>a law of ſin;</hi> The latter, where he repreſents that <hi>carnality,</hi> and <hi>ſinful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity,</hi> under which the <hi>Jew</hi> was, as the cauſe of his <hi>doing what he would not</hi>
                  <note n="(t)" place="margin">Rom. 15.</note>, <hi>and omitting what he would,</hi> That <hi>ſin, which dwelt in him,</hi> as <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the evil</hi>

                  <hi>he committed,</hi> And that <hi>law, that was in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> as <hi>warring againſt the law of his mind</hi>
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Rom. 23.</note>, <hi>and bringing him into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity unto the law of ſin.</hi> For what more could be ſaid on the one hand to ſhew the thing S. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks of to be an <hi>inward evil principle,</hi> and which, becauſe even in thoſe, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36048:74"/>the Law, is much more to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Gentiles? Or what more on the other to ſhew that evil principle to be the <hi>parent of our actual ſins,</hi> yea that which gives being to them all. And I know nothing to take off the force of it, but a ſuppoſition of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> ſpeaking in that place of <hi>Evil habits,</hi> and which as they muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be of the ſame pernicious effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy with Original Corruption, ſo to have been for the moſt part the condition both of <hi>Jew,</hi> and Gentile, before they came to be overtaken by the Goſpel. But how firſt ſuppoſing the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to have ſpoken <hi>only</hi> of <hi>evil habits</hi> (for nothing hinders us from aſſigning them a part in that <hi>Body</hi> of ſin) How firſt, I ſay, doth that agree with the account he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave concerning ſins <hi>entring in</hi>
                  <note n="(x)" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>by Adam,</hi> and our being <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted</hi>

                  <hi>ſinners</hi> by him. For though Original Corruption may come from him, yet evil habits can be only from our ſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently thoſe ſins, that flow from them? How ſecondly ſuppoſing none but evil habits to be here intended, can we make that <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>law of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36048:74"/>ſin,</hi> whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, to be the portion of all, that are under an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Baptiſm, as that Apoſtle plainly ſuppoſeth, when he makes the deſign of Baptiſm<note n="(z)" place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> to be <hi>the deſtruction</hi> of it? For to ſay nothing at preſent concerning the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, becauſe the beſt evidence of their Obligation to Baptiſm is the Corruption of their Nature, and that Obligation therefore rather to be prov'd from Natural Corruption, than Natural Corruption from it; Neither can it be deny'd, even from the Commandment<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note>, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave concerning Baptiſm, that all adult perſons are under an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to it, nor therefore but that they carry about them that <hi>body of ſin,</hi> which Baptiſm was intended for the deſtruction of. But ſo all adult perſons cannot be ſuppoſed to do, if that <hi>body</hi> of ſin be no other, than evil habits; Becauſe it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after that maturity of theirs before they can come to thoſe evil habits, or therefore to be under an Obligation to that <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which is to deſtroy it. In fine, how ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing none but evil habits to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36048:75"/>intended by that <hi>body,</hi> or <hi>law of ſin,</hi> whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks, can we give an account of <hi>ſo holy, and juſt a Law,</hi> as that of <hi>Moſes</hi> is, <hi>ſtirring</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> in thoſe, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and not rather hindring it from coming to effect. For as nothing hinders the propoſing of that Law before ſuch perſons come to any evil habits, and therefore alſo before there is any thing in them to ſtir them up to ſuch a Concupiſcence; So nothing can hinder that Law, when duly propoſed to them, from preventing all ſuch Concupiſcence, as it was the deſign of the Lawgiver to forbid: Becauſe as the perſons we ſpeak of muſt be ſuppoſed to be without any contrariety in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the matter of that Law, which is propos'd; So they muſt alſo be ſuppos'd to be in that ſtate, wherein God had ſet them, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God cannot be thought to place Men in any other eſtate, than that of uprightneſs) in ſuch a ſtate, as will make them willing to liſten to the divine Laws and receive their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from them. By which means the divine Laws ſhall rather keep
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36048:75"/>Men's Concupiſcence from coming to effect, than give any occaſion for the ſtirring of it. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from that, as well as the former arguments, that the evil principle ſpoken of by S. <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be evil habits, and conſequently nothing more left to us to demonſtrate, than that it is derived to us from our Birth, or rather from our Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Womb, which is all, that is affirmed concerning Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Now that that evil prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, whereof we ſpeak, is derived to us from our Birth, will become at leaſt probable from what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid concerning the <hi>earlineſs</hi> of Men's being under ſin, yea their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, as the Scripture inſtructs us, even <hi>from their Youth.</hi> For as it is hard to believe, that all Men ſhould be ſo early under ſin, if it were not from ſome inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that was antecedent to that Age (For what ſhould otherwiſe hinder ſome of them at leaſt from preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their integrity for ſome time, eſpecially ſuppoſing, (as that tender Age maketh it reaſonable to ſuppoſe) a more peculiar watchfulneſs of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36048:76"/>Divine Providence over it?) So it will be much more hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſuppoſing that evil principle to be antecedent to their Youth, that it ſhould not be derived to them from their Conception, and Birth: The Ages preceding that being not in a capacity to produce in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch an evil principle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſuppos'd to have had it tranſmitted to them together with their Nature, and ſo alſo by the ſame means, and from the ſame time, in which that their Nature was. And indeed, as even the tendereſt age falls under death, and not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably therefore concluded to be ſome way, or other under ſin, if (as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> ſpeaks) <hi>death enter'd by it, and ſo paſs'd upon all Men, for that all have ſinned;</hi> So there want not ſome places of Scripture, which do yet more directly evince, that the firſt beginnings of our Nature are tainted with that, of which we ſpeak. Of this ſort I reckon that of <hi>Job</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Job. 14.4.</note>, which is ſo commonly apply'd to this affair, even his demanding of God, with reference to himſelf<note n="(b)" place="margin">Job. 1, &amp;c.</note>, and all other Men, who could <hi>bring a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36048:76"/>clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> and thereby therefore intimating that it was not to be done. For as it is manifeſt from his alledging that the better to countenance his own expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation concerning God's <hi>bringing him into judgment,</hi> that by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> there intimated muſt be meant a ſinful one, as which alone could either diſpoſe him to ſuch actions, as could be a proper matter for judgment, or be alledged in bar to a ſevere one: So it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like manifeſt from <hi>Job</hi>'s asking, <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> that Men are not only ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean in their Nature, but that they become ſo by thoſe evil principles, out of which they are <hi>brought,</hi> and ſo alſo from the time that they were ſeparated from them. Of the ſame Nature is that of our Saviour, where he aſſerts the neceſſity of Men's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>born again of water, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> upon the account of their being before but <hi>fleſh</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Joh. 3.6.</note>, becauſe <hi>born of fleſh.</hi> For as we cannot well underſtand our Saviour of any other <hi>fleſh,</hi> than <hi>fleſh corrupted,</hi> or rather of the whole Nature, that is ſo; Partly becauſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36048:77"/>of the oppoſition, that is there made<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> between a fleſhly, and ſpiritual temper, and partly becauſe that is the moſt uſual notion of it in the New<note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 7.18, 25. Gal. 5.19, 24.</note> Teſtament: So neither therefore but conclude all Men to become ſuch <hi>fleſh</hi> by thoſe <hi>fleſhly</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from whom they are born, and ſo alſo from the time that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their being from them. But of all the Texts of Scripture, which are commonly alledged in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair (even the earlineſs of that evil principle, wherewith we have ſaid all Men to be imbued) there is certainly none of greater force, than the profeſſion, that <hi>David</hi> makes<note n="(f)" place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note>, that he was <hi>ſhapen,</hi> or born <hi>in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and <hi>conceiv'd by his Mother in ſin;</hi> That, if it entreat of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humane Nature, making it as early as the firſt beginnings of it, becauſe ſpeaking as manifeſtly of its Conception<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ham. Annot. in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note>, and Birth. And indeed as we have no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from any thing the Scripture hath ſaid concerning <hi>David,</hi> or his <hi>Parents,</hi> that what he ſpake of his own formation was to be underſtood of that alone; ſo we have much leſs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36048:77"/>reaſon to believe, that he intended any other thing by the <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> thereof, than that Original Corruption, whereof we ſpeak. For beſide that the letter of the Text is moſt agreeable to that notion, and not therefore without manifeſt reaſon to be diverted to another; Beſide that that ſenſe is put upon it by the moſt eminent <hi>Fathers</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Voſſ. Pelag. Hiſt. l. <hi>2.</hi> Part. <hi>1.</hi> Theſ. <hi>1.</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>teſtimonies</hi> of them all; Beſide that that ſenſe hath the ſuffrage of one of the moſt learned<note n="(k)" place="margin">Ham. ubi. ſupra.</note> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, as the thing it ſelf the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentient belief of all the reſt; <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> reſolving the meaning of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to be, that <hi>in the hour of his Nativity the evil figment was planted in his heart,</hi> even that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence</hi> (as he afterward interprets himſelf) <hi>by which he was drawn into ſin:</hi> Beſide all theſe, I ſay, it is no leſs agreeable to the ſcope of the whole Pſalm, and particularly to the care he takes in the Verſe before to condemn himſelf for his offences, and ſo juſtifie the ſeverity of God, if he ſhould think good to take vengeance
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36048:78"/>of them. For what could be more ſutable to that, than to lay open, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his actual ſins, that pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Fountain from whence they came, and ſo ſhew himſelf to be vile upon more accounts, than one, and God to have as many reaſons to chaſtiſe him? And I ſhall only add, that as that ſenſe cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be fairly refus'd, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the <hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> as well as to the <hi>letter</hi> of the Text it ſelf, and to the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Antients,</hi> as well as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; So <hi>they</hi> ſeem to me to add no ſmall confirmation to it, who can find no other means to elude it, than by making the words of the ſame ſence with that <hi>hyperbolical</hi> expreſſion of the ſame Author, where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms<note n="(l)" place="margin">Pſal. 58.3.</note>, that <hi>the wicked are eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Womb, and that as ſoon as they are born, they go aſtray ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lies.</hi> For as it cannot be deny'd that there is a very wide difference between Men's <hi>being conceived, and born in ſin,</hi> and their <hi>going aſtray from their Mother's Womb, and their own birth;</hi> This <hi>latter</hi> expreſſion import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that iniquity, which follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36048:78"/>it, whereas the <hi>former</hi> denotes the condition of the Conception, and Birth it ſelf: So it is evident from what the Pſalmiſt adds in the place alledged concerning the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed's <hi>ſpeaking lies,</hi> that he there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats of <hi>actual ſins,</hi> which as no Man denies to require a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Age for the perpetration of, ſo make it neceſſary to allow an <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole</hi> in it; Whereas the place we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon hath not the leaſt um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of actual ſins, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under no neceſſity of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted conformably to it.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it can hardly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, but if there be ſuch a thing as Original ſin, it will produce ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects in thoſe, in whom it is; And becauſe it can as little be thought, but that thoſe effects will lye open to the obſervation of all, that ſhall take the pains to reflect upon them; Therefore enquire we in the next place, whether that Original Sin, whereof we ſpeak, doth not diſcover it ſelf by <hi>ſutable effects,</hi> and ſo add yet farther ſtrength to what the Scripture hath affirm'd concerning it. A thing not to be doubted of,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36048:79"/>if we reflect upon the behaviour of Children, as ſoon as they come to have any uſe of reaſon. For do not ſome of thoſe, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, <hi>go aſtray from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, ſpeaking lies?</hi> Do not others diſcover in their actions as much of malice, and revenge? Are not a third ſort as refractory to the commands of their Superiours? Doth not a fourth equally pride it ſelf in all it's ſuppoſed excellencies? Now from whence, I beſeech you, proceeds all this untowardneſs of behaviour, but from as untoward a principle, and ſuch a one too, as is interwoven with their very Being, and derived to them with it? For ſhall we ſay from the force of Example? But experience aſſures us of the contrary, becauſe viſible in ſuch Children, as have no ſuch examples before them, and who moreover do not want a ſevere edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to prevent, or correct it. Shall we then ſay from ſome previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits? But the ſame experience aſſures us of the contrary, becauſe it is antecedent to any evil habits, and therefore not imputable to them. Shall we ſay laſtly (and more than
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:36048:79"/>that we cannot ſay) that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their natural tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But as I no way doubt, and ſhall not therefore ſtick to confeſs, that the Corruption of our Nature runs out that way, which our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temperament leads it; So I ſee no neceſſity to grant, that that natural temperament hath any other intereſt in our untowardneſs, than by inclining our natural Corruption to that <hi>particular</hi> evil, to which we are carried. For to make it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way the cauſe of that untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to charge it upon God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt be confeſs'd to be the Author of all that is purely natural in us. Only if it be ſaid, that that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temperament may incline Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, before they have any free uſe of reaſon, to thoſe untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, whereof we ſpeak, and ſo at length by the means of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſſes produce ſuch an habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inclination to them, that their more free reaſon, when they come to it, ſhall not be able to ſurmount it; I anſwer, that that indeed might well enough be granted, if we had no reaſon to believe, that God would
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36048:80"/>ſo watch over them by his providence, as to hinder their natural tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from having ſuch an influence upon them. But as we have reaſon enough to believe, from the love God bears to his own Workmanſhip, as well as to Piety, and Vertue, that he would not be wanting in that particular to the eſtate of Children, if it were no other than ſuch as he himſelf had plac'd them in; So we muſt therefore believe alſo, that that temperament of theirs is not the cauſe of their miſcarriages, but ſomewhat elſe that is not from God, and which, becauſe not from him, he doth not think himſelf under any neceſſity to provide againſt.</p>
               <p>And indeed though ſome, who call themſelves Chriſtians, have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the former evidences, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd themſelves againſt that, which we have offered as the Original cauſe thereof; Yet have the more ſober Heathen, though ignorant of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it, both acknowledg'd, and lamented it, and ſo furniſh'd us with a farther argument for the belief of it. For thus (as Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Coll.</hi> of his Works, Book 10. Ch. 8.</note> did long ſince obſerve) we find one
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36048:80"/>of them affirming that <hi>the nature of Man is prone to luſt,</hi> and another, that <hi>nature cannot ſeparate juſt from unjuſt.</hi> Thus a third (as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Author</hi> remarks) that to <hi>Man of all the creatures is ſorrow gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a portion, to him luxury in innumerable faſhions, and in every Limb; To him alone ambition, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, to him alone an unmeaſurable deſire of living;</hi> In fine, that <hi>whilſt it is given to other creatures, yea the moſt ſavage ones, to live peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and orderly together, Man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally an enemy to thoſe of his own ſtock.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe are thoſe, which are quoted by <hi>Grotius</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">De jure Bedi ac. Pac. li. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi> ſect. <hi>19.</hi> &amp; in Annot. in locum.</note>, if they are not alſo yet more worthy of our remark; Such as are, that <hi>among the other incommodities of mortal nature there is the darkneſs of Men's minds, and not only a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of erring, but a love of errours;</hi> That <hi>we have all ſinned, ſome in weightier inſtances, others in lighter, ſome of ſet purpoſe and deſign, others it may be carried away by other Men's wickedneſs;</hi> That <hi>we do not only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, but we ſhall offend to the end of our lives, and although ſome one may
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:36048:81"/>have ſo purg'd his mind, that nothing ſhall any more diſturb, or deceive him, yet he comes to innocency by offending;</hi> That <hi>this evil diſpoſition is ſo natural to Men, that, if every one be to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that hath it, no Man ſhall be free from puniſhment;</hi> That <hi>there is</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>a neceſſity</hi> upon thoſe, who are entruſted with the power of Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>to wink at ſome errours; He, who puniſheth Men, as if they could be free from all ſin, exceeding the meaſure of that correction, which is according to nature,</hi> or (as another hath expreſſed it) <hi>ſhewing himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the common infirmity of Men, and forgetful of that infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is humane, and univerſal.</hi> For as it is evident from theſe, and the like paſſages, that they, from whom they fell, had the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the State of Nature, which Chriſtianity obligeth us to take up; So that opinion of theirs cannot but add to the confirmation of our own, and to the belief of that depravation, which it is the deſign of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to evince: Becauſe not taken up either in whole, or in part from prejudices imbib'd from Books, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36048:81"/>from the experience they had of its effects, and which as they themſelves could not but feel, and acknowledge, ſo we have no reaſon to queſtion, becauſe conſcious of the like effects of it in our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There being therefore no doubt to be made, but that there is ſuch a thing as Original Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſufficiently atteſted by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scripture, and our own, and other Men's experience; It cannot but be thought reaſonable to enquire, <hi>from whence it had its beginning,</hi> and ſo much the rather becauſe both Scripture, and reaſon aſſure us, that it cannot be thought to have had its Original from God. Now there are but four things, from whence it can be ſuppoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and within the conſideration whereof therefore this Enquiry of ours will neceſſarily be bounded; ſome evil <hi>Daemon,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> which concurrs with God to our production, or the <hi>natural pravity</hi> of that matter, which God makes uſe of in order to it; Some <hi>evil habits,</hi> which Souls contracted, before they were ſent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:36048:82"/>into their preſent bodies, or ſome <hi>pravity in thoſe from whom they firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,</hi> and which is tranſmitted from them to particular ſouls, and perſons. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe opinions is attended with this great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience among many others, that it chargeth God either with maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or impotency; With malignity, if willingly ſuffering any evil ſpirit to mix it ſelf in his productions; With impotency, if not able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, though he would. The <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> as it is alike injurious to the power of God, becauſe ſubjecting that power of his to the indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter, ſo it makes Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin to be natural, and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and conſequently alſo thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ſins, that flow from it. By which means it not only renders all our endeavours againſt them uſeleſs, but caſts a blemiſh upon thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws, which pretend to forbid them, and upon thoſe divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which pretend to puniſh them. For neither can God without great unreaſonableneſs forbid what is not to be avoided, nor puniſh it without the imputation of injuſtice. But it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36048:82"/>may be though Original Sin had not its beginning either from ſome evil ſpirit, or the <hi>pravity of the matter,</hi> which are the two firſt opinions, which pretended to give an account of it; yet it might, as is ſuggeſted in the <hi>third,</hi> ariſe from ſuch <hi>evil habits,</hi> as Men's ſouls contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their deſcent into this World, and into thoſe bodies, wherewith they are inveſted. That indeed might yet more reaſonably be believ'd, that I ſay not alſo (abſtracting from the Authority of the Scripture) much more reaſonably, than the account, that is given of it from <hi>Adam,</hi> if there were but equal reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Men's Souls had any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate exiſtence antecedently to their conception in the Womb. But as that is a thing for which there is not any ſolid ground either in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Scripture, and the ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it therefore the meer iſſue of fancy, and conjecture; So it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confuted by the ignorance Men's Souls are under of any ſuch previous eſtate. For why, if Men's Souls had any ſuch previous exiſtence, ſhould they not be conſcious of it,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36048:83"/>and of the things, that were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them in it? Nay, why ſhould not God take care to fix ſuch a remembrance in them, that ſo what was wanting in their former eſtate might be ſupply'd by them in their following one? For as it is not eaſie to ſuppoſe, that the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body ſhould ſo far ſtupefie the Soul, as to hinder it from emerging in time out of ſleep, in which it may ſeem to have been caſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly from calling to mind what had been before tranſacted within it; Becauſe though the Body may be ſome hindrance to the faculties of the Soul, yet it doth not hinder them from coming in time to exert their proper operations: So it is much leſs eaſie to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould not however bring to it's memory its paſt State, and Actions, by which it offended againſt him; Partly to make it ſenſible of its former guilt, and God's chooſing to puniſh it by thruſting it into a Body, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make it ſo much the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to break off from thoſe ſins, by which it had before offended him; Theſe, as they are the only imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36048:83"/>ends, why God ſhould thruſt an offending Soul into ſuch a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo being perfectly loſt to that Soul, in which there is no conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it's former ſtate, and of thoſe enormities, which were contracted in it. I conclude therefore, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be ſaid as to this particular concerning Original Sin, yet it did not take its riſe from the evil acts, or habits of the Soul in any praexiſtent eſtate, and nothing therefore left to us to reſolve it into, but the <hi>depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe, from whom we all deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and from whom it is tranſmitted to particular Souls, and Perſons.</p>
               <p>I deny not indeed, that even this Account is not without its difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſuch as it will be hard, if not impoſſible perfectly to aſſoile. I deny not farther, that thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are much enhanc'd by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we are under concerning the Original of humane Souls, and which whilſt we continue under, it will not be eaſie for us to ſhew, how that depravedneſs of Nature ſhould paſs from them to us. But as thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are no ways comparable to the difficulties of two of the former, even
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36048:84"/>thoſe, which reſolve Original Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the malignity of ſome evil ſpirit, or the pravity of matter; So they can much leſs be thought to be of force againſt the teſtimony of the Scripture, if that (as I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhew) favour its ariſing from the pravity of our firſt Parents: Partly becauſe the thing in queſtion is a matter of fact, and therefore to be determin'd rather by teſtimony, than the force of reaſon, and partly becauſe the teſtimony of Scripture is the moſt Authentick one, as being no other than the teſtimony of God. Now that there wants not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evidence from thence, that that Original Sin, whereof we ſpeak, ariſeth from the pravity of thoſe, from whom we firſt deſcended, will appear if theſe three things can be made out; Firſt, that the ſin of all mankind enter'd in by <hi>Adam;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it enter'd in by <hi>Adam</hi> not meerly as the firſt that committed it, or tempted other Men by his ill example to do the like, but as more, or leſs the cauſe of all their ſins by his own; Thirdly that he became the cauſe of all their ſins through
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:36048:84"/>his, by depraving thereby his own Nature, and then communicating that depravation to thoſe, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from him.</p>
               <p>That the Sin of all Mankind enter'd in by <hi>Adam,</hi> will need no other proof, than that known Text of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note>, even that <hi>by one Man ſin enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed through unto all Men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> For as we cannot well interpret the word <hi>ſin</hi> of any other, than the ſin of all Men, becauſe there is nothing in the Text to limit it to any particular Man's, ſo much leſs, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards affirm, that that <hi>death,</hi> which enter'd in by it, paſſed thorough unto all Men, <hi>for that,</hi> or becauſe <hi>all had ſinned</hi> by the means of him; That as it makes death to paſs upon all Men with reſpect to their ſeveral ſins, and conſequently their ſeveral ſins to be the immediate door by which it enters, ſo making thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſins therefore to be included in that ſin, which he before affirmed to be the cauſe of that death, and, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it, to have enter'd in by <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:36048:85"/>
               <p> But becauſe among thoſe at leaſt, by whom the Scripture is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, the queſtion is not ſo much, whether all ſin enter'd by <hi>Adam,</hi> but after what manner it enter'd by him; And becauſe, till that be known, we cannot ſpeak with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty concerning the derivation of the corruptneſs of our Natures from that of our firſt Parents or Parent; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs we on to ſhew, according to the method before laid down, that as the ſin of all Mankind enter'd in <hi>by Adam,</hi> ſo it enter'd in by him, not (as ſome have vainly deem'd) meerly as one, who firſt committed it, or tempted others by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to do the like, but as one alſo, yea eſpecially, who by the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant influence of his ſin was more or leſs the cauſe of all thoſe ſins, that followed it. That the ſin of all Mankind enter'd not in by <hi>Adam</hi> either meerly, or principally as one, who firſt committed it, will need no other proof than his being not the firſt committer of ſin even in this ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary World, but that <hi>Serpent,</hi> who tempted our firſt Parents to it. For as he, and his fellow Angels ſinned
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:36048:85"/>before them in thoſe glorious ſeats, in which they were firſt beſtow'd; So he ſinned alſo before them here by that temptation, which he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to them, and without which they had not fallen from their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. Which as it is an evidence of ſin's not entring in by <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſenſe, and conſequently that that was not the ſenſe intended by S. <hi>Paul;</hi> So is the more to be conſidered, becauſe S. <hi>John</hi> attributes this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of ſin to the <hi>Devil</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.</note>, yea makes all the committers of ſin to be therefore <hi>of him.</hi> But beſides that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was not the firſt of thoſe that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and we therefore not ſo to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when deſcribing ſin as entring by him; Neither was he the firſt of humane kind that ſinned, which will be a yet farther preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the former ſurmiſe. For (as we learn from the ſtory of the Fall<note n="(r)" place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note>, yea from this very Apoſtle elſewhere)<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam was not deceiv'd,</hi> that is to ſay, was not the firſt that was ſo, <hi>but the Woman being deceiv'd was in the tranſgreſſion.</hi> Which what is it but to ſay, that ſin did not enter in by <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſenſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36048:86"/>that that was not the ſenſe intended by the Apoſtle in it? On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it be ſaid (and more than that cannot be ſaid in it) that we are not ſo to underſtand S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when deſcribing ſin as entring by <hi>Adam,</hi> as not alſo to ſuppoſe him to connote the Partner both of his Bed, and of his tranſgreſſion; As I will not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to deny the ſuggeſtion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, becauſe believing them both to have contributed to the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our tranſgreſſions, as well as Nature, ſo I cannot forbear to ſay upon the account of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that we ought to conſider <hi>Adam</hi> as the more eſpecial inſtrument in it. Becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> not only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him<note n="(t)" place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note> in particular as the Type, or Figure of him, that was to come, but both deſcribes him all along under the notion of <hi>one Man</hi>
                  <note n="(u)" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.15, 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>, yea makes a great part of the likeneſs, that was between him and Chriſt to conſiſt in it. Which could by no means have been proper, if he had meant no other by ſin's entring in by <hi>Adam,</hi> than entring in by him as one of the firſt committers of it. For in this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:36048:86"/>ſenſe <hi>Eve</hi> muſt neceſſarily have had the preeminence, becauſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offending before her Husband, but tempting even him to do the ſame. From that firſt ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs we to the ſecond, and which indeed is both more antient, and plauſible, than the former. For as it is as old as that <hi>Pelagius</hi>
                  <note n="(w)" place="margin">Vid. Voſſ. Hiſt. Pelag. li. <hi>2.</hi> parte <hi>2. Theſ. 1.</hi>
                  </note>, who firſt call'd Original Sin in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſo it allows the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> to have had an influence upon other Men's ſins, as well as to have given beginning to the being of it. But that it hath as little ſolidity, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency to the words, whereunto it is apply'd, will appear if we reflect upon the ſequel of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe, or the ſubject matter of that, which is offered as the interpretation of it. For is there any reaſon to think (without which that interpretation can be of no avail) that <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin tempted all his poſterity to offend? Nay, is there not reaſon enough to believe, that that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his contributed little to Men's following ſins, yea contributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to many of them? For how many Men have there been,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:36048:87"/>to whom the knowledge of his ſin never reach'd? How many are there yet, who are under the ſame igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or may hereafter be? And muſt not theſe therefore be look'd upon as exempted from the influence of his ill example, and conſequently, if their ſins entred in by <hi>Adam,</hi> be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to have entred ſome other way? And though the ſame be not to be ſaid of thoſe, to whom the Scriptures have come, becauſe thoſe are not without the knowledge of his ſin, nor incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being influenc'd by his example; Yet is there as little reaſon to think, that that example of his contributes much to their ſins, or indeed ever did to theirs, who lived nearer to him, and ſo were more likely to have been inflicted by him. For beſide that a ſin ſo chaſtis'd, as that was, was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely to draw their thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and therefore as little likely to tempt them to the imitation of it; Beſide that many of them might have no actual conſideration of it, as no doubt many now have not, even when they offend in the like kind; They might have been influenc'd, and no doubt were by other ſins of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:36048:87"/>his, as much, or more than by his firſt tranſgreſſion, or by the ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thoſe, that were nearer to them, rather than by any of his. In fine they might have been, and no doubt often were influenced by the baits of pleaſure, or profit, and thereby drawn aſide from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; Theſe having been as apt to influence them, as the example of that ſin, by which their ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are ſuppos'd to have entred into the World. And I ſhall only add, that as that ſenſe cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be reaſonably impos'd, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as no doubt we ought, the ſubject matter of it; So we ſhall find as little encouragement for it from the ſequel of his Diſcourſe, whoſe words are now under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. For beſide that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may ſeem ſufficiently to obviate it by affirming preſently after<note n="(x)" place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note>, that there were many of thoſe, that ſinned, that did not, nor well could ſin <hi>after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adam's <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> becauſe knowing nothing at all of any ſuch poſitive law, as he tranſgreſs'd; It is the main deſign of his Diſcourſe to compare the good,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36048:88"/>that Chriſt brought by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with the hurt which that type of his did by his tranſgreſſion. Which compariſon had been but a <hi>frigid</hi> one, if all the hurt, that <hi>Adam</hi> did us, was by the force of his ill example: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is certain that Chriſt's obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was of a much more efficacious influence in the kind of it, as well as in the degree, and would therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been vilified, than any way illuſtrated, or commended by the compariſon, if the malign influence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin had reach'd no farther, than that of an example. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that what ever was meant by ſin's entring in by <hi>Adam,</hi> yet ſomething more was meant by it, than its entring by him either as the firſt committer of it, or as one, who by his ill example tempted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the like. And indeed as the inſtance but now alledg'd, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the likeneſs, that is between <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and Chriſt's obedience, makes it but reaſonable to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſin as entring alſo by <hi>Adam,</hi> as more, or leſs the cauſe of it, ſo it ſtands yet more confirm'd by what S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms in the ninteenth verſe,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36048:88"/>eſpecially as it lies in the <hi>Original:</hi> The purport thereof being, that Men are <hi>conſtituted</hi> ſinners by his diſobedience, yea that they are ſo <hi>conſtituted</hi> ſinners by it, as Men are conſtituted righteous by the obedience of Chriſt. For though the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may in themſelves be capable of a ſofter ſenſe, and accordingly ſignifie no more, than Men's being reputed, and us'd as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners upon the account of that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, which <hi>Adam</hi> committed; Yet I ſee not how that ſenſe can be thought to fit them here, or indeed any other than that of conſtituting, or making Men ſinners: Partly becauſe their being conſtituted ſinners by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s diſobedience is rendred by S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="(y)" place="margin">Rom. 5.18, 19.</note> as the reaſon of their condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by it, and ought therefore to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from it; And partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſaid to be conſtituted ſinners by <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, as they, who belong to Chriſt, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted righteous by his obedience. For the obedience of Chriſt procuring Men's being really righteous, as well as their being reputed ſuch, yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their being really righteous in ſome meaſure, that they may be ſo
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36048:89"/>accounted of, and us'd; What can be more reaſonable than to think, that that diſobedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is affirmed to be like it, is of the ſame <hi>cauſality,</hi> and accordingly conſtitutes, or makes Men ſinners, as well as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of as ſuch.</p>
               <p>One only thing remains towards the clearing of the matter in hand, even the derivation of the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Nature from that of our firſt Parent, or Parents; And that is, that as all ſin entred in by <hi>Adam</hi> as more, or leſs the cauſe of it by his own, ſo he became the cauſe of it by his own by thereby depraving his own Nature firſt, and then commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating that depravation to thoſe, that deſcended from him. Of the former whereof as there cannot well be any doubt, conſidering the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of that ſin, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (That as it could not but occaſion the withdrawing of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo neither but draw after it the depravation of his Nature, as which receiv'd all its rectitude from the other) ſo there will be as little doubt of the latter, if we compare what S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:36048:89"/>here ſaith concerning <hi>Adam</hi>'s being the cauſe of all our ſins by his own, with what he afterward ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7.17, 20.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Men's falling into actual ſin by vertue of an <hi>evil principle,</hi> that <hi>dwelleth</hi> in them. For if all actual ſin proceed immediately from ſuch an evil principle, that evil principle muſt be alſo from <hi>Adam,</hi> as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which otherwiſe he could not be the cauſe of our ſins by his own, nor conſtitute us ſinners by it.</p>

I may not diſmiſs the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that is now before us, or indeed ſo much as attend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe <hi>Objections,</hi> that are made againſt it, before I have alſo enquir'd, <hi>whether that, which hath the name of</hi> Original Sin, <hi>be truly, and properly ſuch,</hi> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſtiled in reſpect of that <hi>firſt ſin,</hi> from which it proceeded, or in reſpect of <hi>thoſe ſins,</hi> to which it leads. For beſide that that <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe <hi>Catechiſm</hi> I have choſen to explain, leads us to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, becauſe both there, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:36048:91"/>elſewhere<note n="(c)" place="margin">Art. of Relig. 6.</note> affirming it to have the <hi>nature</hi> of a Sin, to make us the <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> and to <hi>deſerve God's Wrath and Damnation;</hi> The reſolution of it is of no ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment toward the right ſtating of our duty, and the valuableneſs of that remedy, which Chriſtianity hath provided for it. For neither other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe can we look upon Original Sin as any proper matter for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whatſoever it may be for our lamentation, nor upon Baptiſm as bringing any other pardon to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, than that of the Sin of their firſt Parents, and which they who look upon Original Sin as rather our unhappineſs, than fault, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as far from charging them with. This only would be premis'd for the better underſtanding of it, that by <hi>Sin</hi> is not meant any actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Law (for no Man was ever ſo abſurd, as to affirm that concerning Original Sin) but that which is contrary to a Law in the nature of an <hi>evil habit,</hi> and both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an abſence of that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ought to be in us, and an inclination to thoſe evils, from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:36048:92"/>which we ought to be averſe; This, as it is no leſs the tranſgreſſion of a Law, than any actual ſin is, ſo making the perſon, in whom it is, as obnoxious to puniſhment, and conſequently to be look'd upon as yet more properly a ſin. Now that that, which we call Original Sin, is really ſuch in this latter notion, will appear if theſe two things be conſidered; Firſt, that the Scripture gives it the title of ſin, Secondly, that it repreſents it as ſuch upon the account of our being obliged by the Law of God to have in us a contrary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. That the Scripture gives that, whereof we ſpeak, the title of ſin, is evident from thoſe Texts, which we before made uſe of to prove the being of it; More particularly from that<note n="(d)" place="margin">Pſa. 51.5.</note>, which repreſents <hi>David</hi> as <hi>conceiv'd, and born in ſin,</hi> and thoſe<note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 7.17-20.</note>, which repreſent us all as having <hi>ſin dwelling in us.</hi> For theſe having been before ſhewn to ſpeak of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin make it evident that the Scripture gives it the title of <hi>Sin,</hi> becauſe in the former places repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it under that notion. And though I will not from that only <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:36048:92"/>conclude it to be properly ſuch, becauſe the Scripture makes uſe of figurative expreſſions, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yea doth ſo in this very particular whereof we ſpeak (for thus it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gives the title of <hi>ſin</hi> to that, which is intended only as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof) yet as we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inferr from thence, that there is more cauſe to believe Original Sin to be <hi>properly,</hi> than <hi>figuratively</hi> ſuch, till the contrary thereof be made appear, The proper ſenſe being otherwiſe to be preferr'd before the figurative; So that there can be no place for the <hi>figurative</hi> ſenſe, if that, which is there repreſented as a <hi>ſin,</hi> be elſewhere repreſented as ſuch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuppoſition of our being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to have in us the contrary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Which that it is will appear from ſuch Texts, as do more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affirm it, or ſuch as affirm thoſe things, from which it may by good conſequence be deduced. Of the former ſort I reckon that, which is immediately ſubjoyn'd by <hi>David</hi> to the mention of his being <hi>conceiv'd in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Pſa. 51.6.</note>. <hi>Behold thou requireſt truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:36048:93"/>parts, and ſhalt,</hi> or rather haſt <hi>made me to underſtand wiſdom ſecretly.</hi> For as we cannot but look upon what is there ſaid concerning God's <hi>requiring truth in the inward parts</hi> as ſpoken with relation to that <hi>ſin,</hi> whereof he before complains, and to the mention whereof he ſubjoyns the mention of the other; So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (conſidering it to have been his intent to aggravate his ſinfulneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God) but look upon it as alſo his intent to aggravate the ſinfulneſs of his frame by that piety which God required of him. Which ſuppos'd, Original Sin will not only be found to be ſo entituled by the Scripture, but to have had that name beſtowed upon it upon the account of Men's obligation to the contrary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to be truely and properly ſuch. And though there be not it may be many more Texts of <hi>that nature,</hi> or which therefore can be thought ſo directly to affirm, that it becometh the ſin of thoſe, in whom it is, upon the account of their obligation to the contrary; Yet will it not be difficult to find others, which do as clearly aſſert thoſe things,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:36048:93"/>from which it may by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be deduced. Such as are thoſe which make Original Sin to be a proper matter for <hi>confeſſion,</hi> yea to induce a guilt upon the perſon, in whom it is. But ſo the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth plainly ſuppoſe in that very Pſalm, which we but now made uſe of; Becauſe not only <hi>confeſſing</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Pſa. 51.5.</note> the ſinfulneſs of his <hi>Nature</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that of his external a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but begging of God, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after that confeſſion of his, that he would <hi>purge him</hi>

For what other then could the Pſalmiſt mean by that Prayer of his, than that God would purge him from that, and his other ſins by the blood of an expiatory Sacrifice? Or ſo meaning be thought to intimate more clearly, than that that, from which he deſir'd to be purg'd, ſtood in need of ſuch a Sacrifice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently was no more without its guilt, than his actual tranſgreſſions were. Only, if that notion may not be thought to be of ſufficient clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to build ſo important a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion on, it will not be difficult to ſtrengthen it yet more by the <hi>word</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> makes us of for <hi>purge,</hi> and thoſe Prayers, which the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſubjoyneth to it; By the former becauſe literally<note n="(l)" place="margin">

               <p n="6">VI. Now though from what hath been ſaid it be competently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that the Doctrine of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin is not without good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to warrant it, yet becauſe that Doctrine hath been impugned by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of Old, and ſince that by the followers of <hi>Socinus,</hi> therefore it may not be amiſs for the farther clearing of it to conſider their Objections againſt it, and either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn a direct, and ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them, or at leaſt ſhew, that they ought not however to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a bar againſt what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath ſaid concerning it. To begin with thoſe Objections which reſpect the being of it, or rather tend to ſhew that it hath no being in the World; Which are either ſuch, as conſider it as a <hi>ſimple cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> of humane Nature, or ſuch
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36048:95"/>as do alſo conſider it as a <hi>ſinful</hi> one. Of the former ſort are thoſe, which repreſent it as a thing unconceivable, how it ſhould come into humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the better to perſuade, they alledge plauſible reaſons againſt all thoſe means, whereby it may be ſuppos'd to find admittance. For theſe being deſtroy'd, they think they may lawfully inferr, that there is indeed no ſuch depravation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humane Nature. Of what force thoſe reaſons are will be then more ſeaſonable to enquire, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is objected againſt the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Original Corruption, or the means by which it is convey'd. At preſent it may ſuffice to ſay, that of what force ſoever they may be thought to be, yet they are not of ſufficient force to deſtroy the being of Original Corruption, which is the thing for which they are here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd; Partly, becauſe many things may be, yea be aſſur'd to us, of the original, or conveyance whereof we our ſelves are perfectly ignorant (for who doubts of the being of humane Souls, though he neither knows, nor well can, whether they be traduc'd,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:36048:95"/>or infus'd) and partly becauſe the teſtimony of Scripture, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience we have of its effects, is a much more forcible argument of the being of it, than all the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are of the other: Theſe being direct, and immediate proofs of its exiſtence, whereas the other are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indirect, and mediate. From ſuch objections therefore as conſider Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin as a ſimple Corruption of humane Nature, paſs we to thoſe, which conſider it alſo as <hi>ſinful,</hi> and which indeed ſeem moſt hardly to preſs upon it: Such as are, that all ſin is the tranſgreſſion of a Law, which Original Sin ſeems not to be; That it requires the conſent of the will of him, in whom it is, which cannot well be affirm'd of that; As in fine, that the Scripture it ſelf may ſeem to make that, which we call Original Sin, rather the <hi>Parent</hi> of Sin, than ſin it ſelf, becauſe making ſin to ariſe<note n="(o)" place="margin">James 1, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> from the <hi>conception,</hi> and <hi>parturition</hi> of it. As to what is objected from the forementioned Scripture, it is either nothing at all to the purpoſe, or very much againſt the purpoſe of thoſe, that alledge
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:36048:96"/>it: Partly becauſe by the <hi>ſin</hi> there ſpoken of can be meant no other, than <hi>actual</hi> ſin, and nothing therefore to be concluded from thence, but that all actual ſin is the product of Men's <hi>Luſt,</hi> and partly becauſe that <hi>Text</hi> makes even actual ſins to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Men's <hi>Luſt,</hi> yea of ſuch a luſt as <hi>draweth them aſide,</hi> and <hi>enticeth</hi> them. For who can well think the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of ſuch Children to be of a better Nature, than the Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, eſpecially when ſhe is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as giving birth to them by falſe, and deceitful Arts? Such Arts as thoſe reflecting no great honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mother, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry making her to be altogether as criminal, as the other. If therefore they, who impugn Original Sin as ſuch, would do it with any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it muſt not be by Arguments drawn from Scripture, which will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt, than profit them, but by Arguments drawn from reaſon, and particularly by ſuch as repreſent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin as no tranſgreſſion of a Law, and therefore no ſin properly ſo call'd, or as a thing which hath not the conſent of the will of him,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36048:96"/>in whom it is, and therefore yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther removed from it. As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former of theſe, even that which repreſents Original. Sin as no tranſgreſſion of a Law, I anſwer that they, who ſo ſpeak, muſt deny it to be ſuch, either becauſe it is no Act, or becauſe there is no Law, which it can be ſuppos'd to be a tranſgreſſion of. If the former of theſe be their meaning, I willingly grant what they alledge, but I ſay withall, that it will not from thence follow, that it is no ſin at all. For if Men are obliged by the divine Law to a pious, and innocent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as well as not to ſwerve from it in their actions, the want of that happy temper, or the having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one will be as much the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Law, as the want of the ſame piety in their actions. Which will conſequently devolve the whole force of that Objection upon the ſuppoſition of there being no ſuch Law of God, which requires the former temper, or which therefore Original Sin can be thought to be a tranſgreſſion of. But as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made it appear in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36048:97"/>that there is in truth ſuch a Law, as requires a pious, and innocent temper, ſo I ſhall now endeavour to ſtrengthen it by ſome more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proofs, and by anſwering thoſe exceptions, that are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>In order to the former whereof we are to know, that as the <hi>Law</hi> we ſpeak of muſt be ſuppoſed to have been given to <hi>Adam,</hi> as that too not only in his <hi>private,</hi> but <hi>publick</hi> capacity, and as he may be thought to have been the <hi>repreſentative</hi> of all Mankind (there being no other Law, which can be ſuppos'd to concern us, before we come to be in a capacity to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and obey it) ſo I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make it appear firſt, that there was ſuch a Law given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and then that it was given to him not only in his <hi>private,</hi> but <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> capacity, and as he may be thought to have been the <hi>repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of all Mankind. Now that there was a Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> requiring a pious, and innocent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as well as the preſerving that piety and innocency in his actions,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:36048:97"/>will need no other proof than God's creating him in it, and the love he may be ſuppoſed to bear unto it. For as we cannot think God would have ever intruſted ſuch a Jewel with <hi>Adam,</hi> if it had not been his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he ſhould preſerve, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it, ſo much leſs, when the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> of the <hi>divine Nature</hi> perſuades his love to it, as well as the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his word. For what were this, but to make God indifferent, what became of his moſt excellent gifts, which no wiſe perſon, and much leſs ſo hearty a lover of them can be ſuppoſed to be? If therefore there can be any doubt concerning the <hi>Law</hi> we ſpeak of, it muſt be as to its having been given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>publick</hi> capacity, and as he may be ſuppos'd to have been the <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative</hi> of all Mankind. Which I ſhall endeavour to evince firſt by ſhewing what I mean by his <hi>publick</hi> capacity, ſecondly by ſhewing that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſet in ſuch a capacity, and thirdly that the Law we ſpeak of was given to him as conſidered in it. By the <hi>publick</hi> capacity of <hi>Adam</hi> I mean ſuch a one, whereby as he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:36048:98"/>was deſign'd to be the Father of all Mankind, ſo God made him a kind of Truſtee for it; In order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both giving him what he did for their benefit, as well as his own, and obliging him for their ſakes, as well as his own, to ſee to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, and act agreeably to it. Which if he did, his Poſterity as well as himſelf ſhould have the benefit thereof, and God's favour together with it, but if not, forfeit together with him what God had ſo beſtow'd upon him, and incurr the penalty of his diſpleaſure. Now that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſet in ſuch a capacity (which is the ſecond thing to be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) will appear from the Scriptures making him the cauſe of all Men's death by his offence, and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For the effects of another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience being not otherwiſe charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon any Man, than as that other may be ſuppos'd to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to act for him; If the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience were to fall upon all his Poſterity, he alſo muſt be ſuppoſed to have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to act for them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to have been ſet in that <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:36048:98"/>capacity, whereof I ſpeak. Which will leave nothing more for us to ſhew upon this Head, than that that Law, which requires a pious and innocent temper was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in that capacity. But as we can as little doubt of that, if his contracting a contrary temper was as fatal to his Poſterity, as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; So that it was, will need no other proof than his producing the like temper in them, and that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's proving as deadly to them. The former whereof is evident from what I before ſaid to ſhew, that <hi>Original Sin</hi> had its beginning from <hi>Adam,</hi> the latter from S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s<note n="(p)" place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> calling it a <hi>Body of Death,</hi> or a Body that brings it: The <hi>Genitive Caſe</hi>

               <p>I deny not indeed (that I may now paſs to thoſe Exceptions that are commonly made againſt it) that it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:36048:99"/>may ſeem hard to conceive how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſhould be ſet in ſuch a <hi>capacity,</hi> as to involve all mankind in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or miſery, according as he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued in, or fell from that integrity, wherein God created him. I deny not therefore, but that it is equally hard to conceive how God ſhould give him ſuch a <hi>Law,</hi> the obſervation, or tranſgreſſion whereof on his part ſhould redound to the account of his Poſterity. But as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, that is hard to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, is not therefore to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, if it be otherwiſe ſtrengthen'd with ſufficient proofs; So it would be conſider'd alſo, whether it be not much more hard to conceive, how God ſhould otherwiſe involve In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and Children in thoſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, into which they often fall, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in National Judgments: It being certainly more agreeable to the divine Juſtice, to conceive thoſe to have ſome way, or other offended, and conſequently thereto to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under the diſpleaſure of it, than to conceive them to ſuffer it without any offence at all. For why then ſhould we not think, eſpecially when
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:36048:99"/>the Scripture hath led the way, that God oblig'd them in <hi>Adam</hi> to a pious, and innocent temper, and which they loſing in him, they became obnoxious with him to the ſame ſad effects of his diſpleaſure? And though it be true, that there is this great imparity between the caſes, that the effect of God's diſpleaſure upon occaſion of <hi>Original Sin</hi> is made to reach to eternal miſery, as well as to a temporal one, whereas the caſe we before inſtanc'd in concerns only a temporal puniſhment: Yet as they do thus far agree, that a puniſhment is inflicted, where there is no actual ſin to deſerve it, which is ſufficiently irreconcileable with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we otherwiſe have of the divine Juſtice; So that great imparity may be much abated by conſidering, that God hath provided a Plaſter as large as the Sore, (even by giving his Son to dye for all Mankind) and appointed the Sacrament of Baptiſm to convey the benefit of it. For as the conſequents of Original Sin will be thereby taken off from ſo many Infants at leaſt, as are admitted to that Sacrament, ſo that mercy of his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:36048:100"/>to thoſe, and the aſſurance we have from the Scripture of his giving his Son to dye for all may perſwade us to believe, that though he hath not reveal'd the particular way to us, yet he hath ſome other way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the benefit of that death to thoſe, who are not admitted to the other.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid it may be (which is a no leſs prejudice againſt the being of Original Sin) that all ſin, to make it truly ſuch, muſt have the conſent of the will of thoſe, in whom it is, as well as be the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Law. A thing by no means to be affirm'd concerning that, which we call Original Sin, becauſe not only contracted before we had a being, and therefore alſo before we had ſo much as the <hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>willing,</hi> but moreover conveyed to us, when we had neither reaſon to apprehend it, nor any power in our <hi>wills</hi> either to admit, or reject it. And indeed how altogether to take off the force of that Objection is beyond my capacity to apprehend, or ſatisfie the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of other Men: Becauſe as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how any thing can be a ſin,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:36048:100"/>which hath not alſo the conſent of the will of thoſe, in whom it is, ſo I am as little able to conceive how Original Sin ſhould have the conſent of ours, either when it was firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or when it was tranſmitted to us. But as I am far leſs able to conceive how Infants, and Children ſhould come to be ſo ſeverely dealt with without any offence at all, or therefore without having ſome way, or other conſented to one; So I think firſt, that that difficulty may well be laid in the ballance againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea alledged as a bar to the ſuppoſed force of it. For why ſhould my inability to apprehend how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and Children could conſent to Original Sin, prevail with me to deny the being of it, when a far greater inability to apprehend how the ſame perſons ſhould come to be ſo ſeverely dealt withal without it, doth not prevail with me to deny that ſevere uſage of them? Neither will it avail to ſay (which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſiderable enough) that we have for the belief of this laſt the teſtimony of our ſenſes, which is not to be alledged as to the other.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:36048:101"/>For the queſtion is not now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſevere uſage of Infants, and Children may not more reaſonably be believ'd, than their Original Sin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there may be of it; But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we can any more deny the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin of Infants, and Children upon the account of our inability to apprehend, how they ſhould conſent unto it, than we can deny the ſevere uſage of the ſame perſons upon the account of our inability to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how they ſhould come to be ſo dealt with without the other. Which that we cannot is evident from hence, that we are equally at a loſs in our apprehenſions about the one, and the other, that I ſay not alſo more at a loſs about the latter, than about the former. And indeed, as we find it neceſſary to believe many things notwithſtanding our ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to apprehend how they ſhould come to paſs, and ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deny the being of any one thing upon the ſole account of that inability; So our apprehenſions are ſo ſhort as to the modes of thoſe things, of the being whereof we are
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:36048:101"/>moſt aſſured, that it will hardly be deemed reaſonable to inſiſt upon the ſuggeſtions of them, againſt the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of the Scripture: Partly becauſe of the Authority of him, from whom it proceeded, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe we cannot ſo eaſily fail in our apprehenſion concerning the due ſenſe of the affirmations of it, as in the deductions of our own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerning the things affirmed; Nothing more being required to the underſtanding of the one, than a due conſideration of the ſignification of the words, wherein they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; whereas to the right order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the other, there is requir'd a due underſtanding of the Nature of thoſe things about which we reaſon, which is both a matter of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulty, and in many caſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be attain'd. Whatever difficulty therefore there may be in apprehending how Original Sin could have the conſent of thoſe, in whom it is ſuppoſed to be, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how it ſhould be truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a ſin; Yet ought not that to be a bar againſt our belief of it, if the Scripture hath repreſented it as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:36048:102"/>ſuch, and which whether it hath, or no, I ſhall leave to be judg'd by what I have before obſerv'd from it.</p>
               <p>From ſuch Objections, as are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd more immediately againſt the <hi>being</hi> of Original Sin, paſs we to thoſe which impugne the derivation of it from <hi>Adam,</hi> and from whom we have affirmed it to proceed. Which Objections again do either tend to ſhew, that it had its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from ſomething elſe, or that it cannot be ſuppos'd to have its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from <hi>Adam.</hi> An opinion hath prevail'd of late years, that that, which we call Original Sin, took its riſe from the ſins of particular Souls in ſome <hi>praexiſtent</hi> eſtate, and from thoſe <hi>evil habits,</hi> which they contracted by them. And certainly the opinion were reaſonable enough to be embrac'd, if the <hi>praexiſtence</hi> of Souls were but as well prov'd, as it is ſpeciouſly contriv'd. For, that ſuppos'd, it would be no hard matter to give an account of the riſe of that Corruption, which is in us, nor yet of God's afflicting thoſe on whom no other blame appears: That cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as it is no other than what
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:36048:102"/>particular Souls have themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, ſo making them as obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the vengeance of God, as any after ſins can be ſuppoſed to do. But do they, who advance this <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> think the plauſibleneſs thereof a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to build it on? Or are <hi>problems</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> no other way to be determin'd, than thoſe of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> or other ſuch <hi>conjectural</hi> Arts are? I had thought that for the reſolution of theſe we ought rather to have had recourſe to that <hi>word</hi> of God, which was deſign'd to give us an underſtanding of them, to have examin'd the ſeveral aſſertions of it, and acquieſced in them, how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult ſoever to be apprehended. I had thought that we ought to have done ſo much more, where the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture profeſſeth to deliver its opinion, and doth not only not wave the thing in queſtion, but ſpeaks to it. Which that it doth in the preſent caſe will need no other proof than the account it gives of the Original of Mankind, and then of the Original of Evil. For as it profeſſeth to ſpeak of <hi>Adam</hi> not only as created by God, but as appointed by him<note n="(r)" place="margin">Gen. 1.28.</note> to give being by the way of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:36048:103"/>natural Generation to all, that after him ſhould repleniſh the Earth (which how he ſhould be thought to do, if he were only to be a means of furniſhing them with a Body, who had the <hi>better</hi> part of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, is paſt my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to imagine) ſo it profeſſeth to ſpeak of the ſame <hi>Adam</hi> as one by whom <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>death</hi>
                  <note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Rom. 5.12. 1 Cor. 15.21, 22.</note> enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, as well as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe, on whom it ſeizeth. And can there then be any place for a precarious <hi>hypotheſis</hi> about the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Mankind, or the evils of it? Can there be place for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that <hi>hypotheſis</hi> not only beſide, but againſt the determinations of the Scripture? Do not all ſuch <hi>hypotheſes</hi> proceed upon the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the matter, about which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant? Do they not come in as a relief to the underſtandings of Men, where they cannot be ſatisfied any other way? But how then can there be place for ſuch a one, where the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath determin'd? How can there be any place even for the moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and plauſible? For as that cannot be ſuppos'd to be <hi>uncertain,</hi> which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:36048:103"/>the Scripture hath determin'd; So no plauſibility whatſoever can come in competition with the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, ſuch as thoſe of the Scripture are. But ſuch it ſeems is the reſtleſneſs of ſome Men's minds, that if they cannot ſatisfie their ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from what the Scripture hath advanced, they will be ſetting up other <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> to do it by. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet they are for the moſt part ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky, as to advance ſuch things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as have nothing at all of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in them. For who can think it any way probable, that, if mens Souls had an exiſtence antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their conception in the Womb, they ſhould not in the leaſt be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of it, nor of any of thoſe things, which were tranſacted by them in it? Is it (as one hath obſerv'd, who ſeems to have been the firſt broacher of it in this latter Age) is it, I ſay, for want of opportunity of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded of their former tranſactions, as it happens to many, who riſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that they ſlept without dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet before they go to bed again recover a whole ſeries of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations by ſomething that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:36048:104"/>to them in the day? But who can think, when the Souls of Men muſt be ſuppoſed to carry in them the ſame evil tendencies, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that they ſhould never light upon any one thing, which might bring back to their minds what they had formerly tranſacted, or but ſo much as that they had a being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to their preſent one? For whoever was ſo forgetful of his dreams, as not to remember he was ſometime in a dreaming condition, yea that he actually dreamed in it? Is it ſecondly (as the ſame Learned Man goes on) by a deſuetude of thinking of their former actions, and whereby it ſometimes comes to paſs, as he there obſerves, that what we have earneſtly meditated, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd for, and pen'd down with our own hands, when we were at School, becomes ſo loſt to our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, that if we did not ſee our own handwriting to it, we ſhould not acknowledge it to be our own? But doth this come home to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe? Doth it perſuade ſuch a forgetfulneſs in the Souls of Men, as not only not to remember their
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:36048:104"/>particular actions, but not ſo much as that they were in a condition to act any thing, or acted any thing under it? For though a Man may forget the particular exerciſe he did at School, yet can any Man (though he ſlept an Age, and never ſo much as dream'd in all that time of being at School, or any other thing, be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, if he awoke in his right wits, to forget he was ſometime in ſuch a place, and performed ſome exerciſes in it? Is it laſtly by means of ſome diſtemper, that happens to the Soul by coming into an earthly Body, and by which the foremention'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conceives the Soul may ſuffer in its memory, as we ſee it ſometime doth in its preſent ſtate by caſualties, and diſeaſes, yea ſo far as to make the perſon forget his own name? But though the Soul ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to fall into ſuch a forgetfulneſs by entring into a body (as we ſee it is a long time before it comes to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe its reſpective faculties) yet is there any reaſon to think it ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it after it hath gotten above the infirmities of the other, yea ſo far as to reaſon with that clearneſs,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:36048:105"/>wherewith this Author doth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and with great plauſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all others? For though Men may happen to be ſo ſtricken by a diſeaſe, as to forget even their own names, yea have undoubtedly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in that nature; yet is there no evidence from ſtory that I know of, or indeed preſumption for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it, that though the parties did again recover the free uſe of their faculties, yet they were unable to look back to their priſtine ſtate, or call to mind any of the paſſages thereof. So much more ſpecious, than ſtrong are the reaſons that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor alledgeth to ſhew the Soul to be in a natural incapacity to call to mind its priſtin ſtate, and actions. And yet if they prov'd what they intended, they would hardly make it credible, that it ſhould be without all knowledge of them: God, who thruſts it down into its preſent ſtate by reaſon of its former errours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likely enough to bring them to its mind, though it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ignorant of them. Otherwiſe he ſhould neither make it ſenſible of its own guilt, and his chooſing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:36048:105"/>thus to puniſh it, which is one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed end of his thruſting it down, nor careful to break off from it, which is another. And I ſhall only add, that as we cannot therefore be in any great danger from thoſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which pretend to derive Original ſin from another principle; So ſhall we not now be much incommoded by the force of thoſe Objections, which profeſs more directly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn the derivation of it from <hi>Adam.</hi> For as thoſe Objections are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally founded upon the incompeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Adam</hi> to involve all mankind in the guilt of his tranſgreſſion, ſo I have not only made it appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that <hi>Adam</hi> was no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent for that purpoſe, becauſe appointed by God as the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all mankind, but ſaid enough, though not to anſwer, yet to ſilence what is objected againſt it from the ſuppoſed want of our conſent to his tranſgreſſion. Which will leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more for us to do, than to conſider what is objected againſt the <hi>means,</hi> we have before aſſign'd of the conveying of that Original Sin whereof we ſpeak. But as I
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:36048:106"/>have not been poſitive in aſſigning the <hi>particular</hi> means of its conveyance, and muſt therefore be the leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to anſwer what is objected againſt them; So I ſhall oppoſe to all thoſe Objections the aſſurance we have from the Scripture of our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in us from our Conception, and Birth, yea contracting it from thoſe fleſhly, and unclean perſons, from whom we are deſcended: That, as it is enough to ſhew that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us by the ſame general means, by which our very nature is, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it at leaſt probable that it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from them to us together with our Souls, and from thence diffuſeth it ſelf unto our Bodies. And how far a probability ſo founded ought to prevail againſt all the Arguments, which are oppos'd to the traduction of Souls, eſpecially when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſeems to favour that traduction alſo, will be no hard matter for him to judge, who ſhall conſider on the one hand the ſhortneſs of our own reaſonings, and on the other what difficulties attend the Creation, and Infuſion, as well as the tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Souls. For as thoſe very
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:36048:106"/>difficulties will oblige us to ſit down after all with a probable aſſent in this affair, ſo the ſhortneſs of our own reaſonings to guide that aſſent rather by probable teſtimonies of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, than by probable arguments from Reaſon: Becauſe as we are more aſſur'd of the truth of thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, than we can be of the truth of any of thoſe arguments, which we ground our ſelves upon in this affair; So we cannot ſo eaſily fail in our apprehenſions concerning the other; Nothing more being requir'd toward the apprehending the force of the former, than the due conſideration of the ſenſe of the words, wherein they are expreſſed, whereas to the apprehending of the force of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we muſt have a clear knowledge of the nature of thoſe things, about which they are converſant, which is certainly a matter of far greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and wherein therefore we may more eaſily miſtake. Only if what is ſaid in this particular may not be thought to be ſatisfactory, becauſe rather a bar to what is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt the traduction of Souls
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:36048:107"/>(and conſequently of Original Sin) than any direct anſwer to it; I ſhall deſire thoſe, who are diſſatisfi'd with it, to give ſuch an anſwer, as they themſelves demand to what is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the other party againſt the immediate Creation, and infuſion of them: It ſeeming not ſo eaſie to imagine (that I may not now preſs them with any other inconveniencies) that God ſhould create a Soul on purpoſe to infuſe it into ſuch ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous conceptions, as he himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be thought to abhor. For my ſelf, as I can with equal eaſe digeſt the traduction of Souls with all its inconveniencies, or rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in that evidence, which the Doctrine of the Scripture, and the ſimple nature of a generation do ſeem to ſuggeſt; So I ſhall hardly think it reaſonable to quit it, till they, who aſſert the Creation of Souls, free it from the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and other ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, wherewith it is alike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred. For till that be done, the traduction of Souls will not only be of greater probability, but ſerve
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:36048:107"/>more clearly to declare how that corruption, which our firſt Parents contracted, paſſed from them unto their Children, and ſo on to ſucced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations.</p>

                     <hi>The Contents.</hi> The things ſignified by Baptiſm are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more general, or particular: More general, as that Covenant of Grace, which paſſeth between God, and Man, and that body of Men, which enter into Covenant with him; More particular, what the ſame God doth, by vertue of that Covenant, oblige himſelf to beſtow upon the Baptized, and what thoſe Baptized ones do on their part undertake to perform. Theſe latter ones propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be conſidered, and entrance
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:36048:109"/>made with the conſideration of what God obligeth himſelf to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Baptized, called by the Church, <hi>An inward, and ſpiritual Grace.</hi> Which inward, and ſpiritual Grace is ſhewn to be of two ſorts, to wit, ſuch as tend more immediately to our ſpiritual, and eternal welfare, or ſuch as only qualifie us for thoſe Graces, that do ſo. To the former ſort are reckon'd that inward, and ſpiritual Grace, which tends to free us from the guilt of ſin, called by the Church <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin;</hi> That which tends to free us from the pollution of ſin, called by our Catechiſm <hi>A death unto it;</hi> And that, which tends to introduce the contrary purity, and hath the name of a <hi>New birth unto righteouſneſs.</hi> To the latter ſort is reckoned <hi>our union to that Body,</hi> of which Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Head, and by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he diſpenſeth the former Graces to us. Each of theſe reſum'd, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their order, and ſhewn to be, what they are uſually ſtil'd, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpiritual Graces of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or the things ſignified by the outward viſible Sign thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:36048:109"/>
               <p> BUT to return to that, from which I have diverted, even the <hi>things ſignified</hi> by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible ſign of Baptiſm, which are either more general, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: More <hi>general,</hi> as that <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, which paſſeth between God, and Man, and that Body of Men, which enter into Covenant with him; More particular, what the ſame God doth by vertue of that Covenant oblige himſelf to beſtow upon the Baptized, and what thoſe Baptized ones do on their part make profeſſion of. Of thoſe more <hi>general</hi> things I have given ſome account al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in general, Part 2.</note>, and ſhall have occaſion, as I go, to add yet farther light to them; I will therefore proceed forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the conſideration of the more particular ones, ſuch as are on the part of God an <hi>inward and Spiritual Grace,</hi> and on the part of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd an <hi>abrenuntiation of their former ſins,</hi> and a reſolution to believe, and act, as Chriſtianity obligeth them to do.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:36048:110"/>
               <p> Now the <hi>inward and Spiritual Grace</hi> of Baptiſm is of two ſorts, to wit, ſuch as <hi>tend more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to our ſpiritual, and eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi> or ſuch as only <hi>qualifie us for thoſe Graces,</hi> that do ſo. Of the former ſort again is that inward and Spiritual Grace, which tends to free us from the guilt of ſin, beſt known by the name of <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> or that which tends to free us from the pollution of ſin, called by our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm <hi>a death unto it,</hi> or laſtly that which tends to introduce the contrary purity, and hath the name of <hi>a new birth unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> Of the latter ſort is our <hi>union to that body,</hi> of which Chriſt Jeſus is the head, and by means of which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth the former Graces to us. For that each of theſe is ſignified on the part of God by the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is a part of its inward and Spiritual Grace, will appear if we deſcend to particulars, which therefore I will now ſet my ſelf to do.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:36048:110"/>
               <p> To begin with thoſe inward, and Spiritual Graces, which <hi>tend more immediately</hi> to our ſpiritual, and eternal welfare; Among which as I aſſign'd the firſt place to <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin,</hi> ſo I ſhall make it my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſhew firſt, that that is a Grace which is ſignified by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible ſign of Baptiſm, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly give a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature of that forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I have ſaid to be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the other.</p>
               <p>That <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin</hi> is a Grace ſignified by the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm, will appear if theſe two things can be made out; Firſt, that the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm hath a relation to the forgiveneſs of ſin, and Secondly that it hath the relation of a ſign unto it. For if the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm hath the relation of a ſign to the forgiveneſs of ſin, Forgiveneſs of ſin, as being its <hi>correlatum,</hi> muſt be look'd upon as ſignified by it. That the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm hath a <hi>relation</hi> to the forgiveneſs of ſin, S. <hi>Peter</hi> will not ſuffer us to doubt, becauſe admoniſhing<note n="†" place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> the <hi>Jews</hi> to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:36048:111"/>be <hi>baptiz'd for the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> And as little doubt can there well be of its having the relation of a <hi>ſign</hi> unto it, which is the only thing we are at preſent to conſider: Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe Baptiſm hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in general, Part 2.</note> ſhewn to have been intended by God as a ſign of many things, and why then not as a ſign of that forgiveneſs, to which I have ſhewn it equally to relate, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is propos'd to us as <hi>waſhing away</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts 22.16.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſins</hi> of thoſe, that are ſprinkled with it. For as if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſm be to be conſidered as <hi>waſhing away Men's ſins,</hi> it muſt be upon the account of its being a ſign of that inward Grace thereof, that doth ſo, as which alone can be a juſt foundation of attributing ſuch a property to it (for neither can the Water of Baptiſm put away Men's ſins, but by means of that Grace, which it conveys, nor with any propriety even ſo be ſaid to <hi>waſh</hi> them away, but upon the account of the likeneſs there is between its own natural property, and that of the divine Grace, which will make the Water of Baptiſm a ſign, or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:36048:111"/>of it) So if the Water of Baptiſm be to be conſidered as <hi>waſhing</hi> away Men's ſins, it will equally lead us to believe, that it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in particular as a ſign of that forgiveneſs, whereof we ſpeak: Partly, becauſe that forgiveneſs is an undoubted <hi>correlatum</hi> of Baptiſm, and partly becauſe the term of <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> away Men's ſins is moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of to denote the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and that outward ſign therefore, to which ſuch a waſhing is attributed, intended as a ſign of the forgiveneſs of them. I conclude therefore that whatever elſe may be thought to be excluded from the ſignification of the Water of Baptiſm, yet it hath the relation of a ſign to the forgiveneſs of ſin, and that forgiveneſs therefore to be look'd upon as one of the <hi>Graces</hi> ſignified by it. And I ſhall only add, that this was always ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd in the Church, that even the <hi>Pelagians</hi> themſelves, though they deny'd all ſin in Infants, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently left no place for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin in them, yet did allow of their being <hi>Baptiz'd for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:36048:113"/>having a relation to our death unto ſin, as well as unto the death of Chriſt; So they prove in like manner, that it had the relation of a ſign unto it, and conſequently make the former death to be one of the Graces ſignified by it: Becauſe not only deſcribing the Rite of Baptiſm under the notion of a <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> which it cannot be ſaid to be, but as it is an image of one, but repreſenting it as a <hi>planting</hi> of the Baptized perſon into the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of that death of Chriſt, which is the <hi>exemplar</hi> of the other. For what is this but to ſay, that it was intended as a ſign, or repreſentation of them both, and both the one, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore to be look'd upon as ſignified by it. The ſame is to be ſaid upon the account of thoſe Texts of Scripture, which repreſent the Water of Baptiſm as <hi>waſhing</hi>

                  <hi>the Church, to the end it may be holy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh.</hi> For as that ſhews the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:36048:114"/>Water of Baptiſm to have a relation to that grace, which tends to free the Church from ſinful blemiſhes, ſo it ſhews in like manner, that it was intended as a ſign of it, and of that inward cleanſing, which belongs to it: There being not otherwiſe any reaſon why the freeing of the Church from ſin by means of the Baptiſmal water ſhould have the name of <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> but upon the account of the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy there is between the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty thereof, and the property of that Grace, to which it relates.</p>
               <p>One only Grace remains of thoſe, which tend more immediately to our ſpiritual welfare, even that which our Catechiſm entitles a <hi>new birth unto righteouſneſs.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I ſhall again ſhew (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that will be enough to prove, that it is a Grace ſignified by it) that the Water of Baptiſm hath a relation to it, and then that it hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a ſign. I alledge for the former of theſe S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s entitling it the <hi>laver of regeneration</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note>, as our Saviour's affirming<note n="(p)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> before him, that we are <hi>born again</hi> of that, as well as <hi>of the Spirit;</hi> For the latter what
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:36048:114"/>hath been before ſhewn in the general concerning its having been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſign of the things, to which it relates. For if the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm were intended as a ſign of thoſe things, to which it relates, it muſt conſequently have bin intended as a ſign of our new birth, becauſe by the former Texts as manifeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it. But ſo we ſhall be yet more fully perſwaded, if it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it a repreſentation of that new birth, to which it doth relate. Which that it doth will need no other proof, than its being an apt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of that ſpiritual purity, which the Soul puts on at its firſt converſion, and wherein indeed its new birth<note n="(q)" place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> conſiſts. For ſo it is in part by that cleanſing quality, which is natural to it, and which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a purity in thoſe bodies, to which it is applied; But eſpecially by the uſe that was formerly made of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the waſhing of new-born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from thoſe impurities, which they contracted from the Womb: This laſt ſerving to ſet forth the firſt beginnings of our ſpiritual pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as well as the former doth that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:36048:115"/>purity it ſelf. And I ſhall only add, that as a reſurrection from the Dead is alſo a kind of new Birth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſo repreſented by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves (witneſs their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling our Saviour upon the account of his Reſurrection <hi>the firſt-begotten</hi>
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Col. 1.18.</note>

                  <hi>Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee</hi>) So the ſame Scriptures do not only repreſent our new birth unto Righteouſneſs under the notion of a Reſurrection, but ſufficiently intimate that whether Birth or Reſurrection to be a Grace ſignified by it: Becauſe not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing us to look upon our ſelves as <hi>a live unto God</hi> by Baptiſm<note n="(u)" place="margin">Rom. 6.11.</note>, as well as <hi>dead unto ſin</hi> in it, but as <hi>riſen</hi>

                  <hi>with Chriſt therein through the faith of the operation of him, who raiſed him from the dead.</hi> For how come Men by reaſon of their being alive unto God through Baptiſm to be affirmed to have riſen with Chriſt in it, but upon the account of that Baptiſm of theirs being a repreſentation of that new life, or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:36048:115"/>birth, which we have by the means of it, as well as of the Reſurrection of our Saviour?</p>
               <p>I will conclude what I have to ſay concerning the inward, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Grace of Baptiſm, when I have taken notice of that, which though it do not immediately tend to our ſpiritual, and eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, yet qualifies us for thoſe Graces, that do; Even our <hi>union to that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> of which Chriſt Jeſus is the Head, and by means of which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth the other graces to us. For that that is alſo ſignified by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible ſign of Baptiſm, will appear if we conſider that viſible ſign as having a relation to it, and then as having the relation of a ſign. Of the former whereof as S. <hi>Paul</hi> will not ſuffer us to doubt, becauſe affirming all<note n="(x)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be <hi>baptiz'd</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that body; So there will be as little doubt of the other from the general deſign of its inſtitution, and from what S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates in the former place concerning it: That expreſſion of being <hi>baptized into</hi> the body of Chriſt importing our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:36048:116"/>receiv'd by Baptiſm within it, as the body of the Baptized is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe waters, wherein he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed. Which will conſequently make that Rite a true, and proper ſign of Our Union to Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that union therefore a thing ſignified by it.</p>
               <p>Such are the things, which are by Baptiſm ſignified <hi>on the part of God, and Chriſt,</hi> or (that I may ſpeak in the language of our Church) the <hi>inward, and ſpiritual Graces</hi> thereof. It remains that I alſo ſhew the things ſignified by it <hi>on the part of the Baptized,</hi> even an Abrenunciation of their former ſins, and a reſolution to believe, and act, as Chriſtianity obligeth them to do. But becauſe both the one, and the other of theſe will be more clearly underſtood, if they be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led apart, and whatſoever is to be known concerning each of them laid as near together as may be; Therefore having begun to entreat of the inward and ſpiritual Grace of Baptiſm, I will continue my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning it, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly go on to enquire <hi>what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And it ought the rather to be taken notice of, becauſe as it bears witneſs to that forgiveneſs of ſin by Baptiſm, which hath been hitherto our deſign to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, ſo it will contribute in part toward the proving, what comes next in order, even</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:36048:122"/>
               <p> That the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm hath that relation, whereof we ſpeak, to the forgiveneſs of <hi>all ſins</hi> whatſoever, and particularly of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin:</hi> There being little doubt as to the former of theſe, if (as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is there made to ſpeak) <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and murther were waſh'd away by the waters of it.</hi> But ſo that Chriſtianity it ſelf taught, as well as was affirmed by this its adverſary to do, is not only evident from what hath been elſewhere ſaid<note n="(i)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed.

But therefore as I cannot either conceive, or allow of any other abatement in this forgiveneſs, than that which is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:36048:122"/>to be made upon account of the <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and which what it is, hath been elſewhere<note n="(o)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed.

Not that there can be any great doubt as to the pardon of that, where it appears that the moſt <hi>heinous actual</hi> ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but becauſe Baptiſm hath been thought by our <hi>Church</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">See the Office of Bapt. and the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</note> to have a more peculiar reference to it, and becauſe if it can be prov'd to have ſuch a reference to its forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it will be of ſignal uſe to ſhew the neceſſity of baptizing Infants, in whom that ſin doth alike predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. Now though it be hard to find any one Text of Scripture, where that forgiveneſs, whereof we ſpeak, is expreſly attributed to Baptiſm; Yet will it not be difficult to deduce it from that<note n="(q)" place="margin">Eph. 2.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn to entreat of our becoming the <hi>children of wrath by nature,</hi> as well as by the wickedneſs of our converſations.

               <p>Such evidence there is of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible ſign of Baptiſm being a <hi>means</hi> fitted by God to convey that forgiveneſs, whereof we ſpeak; And we ſhall need no other proof than that of its being alſo a <hi>pledge</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the baptized perſon of it.

               </argument>
               <p>I Have conſidered the ſign of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm hitherto in its relation to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,</hi> that Grace, which tends to free men from their guilt, and is for that purpoſe convey'd by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to us; I come now to conſider it in its relation to thoſe, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tend to free them from the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſin, beſt known by the name of a <hi>Death unto it,</hi> or to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the contrary righteouſneſs, and is call'd a <hi>new birth unto it.</hi> Where again I ſhall ſhew in each of them, that as the outward work of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm hath the relation of a <hi>ſign</hi> unto them, ſo it hath equally the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a <hi>means</hi> fitted by God to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:36048:125"/>convey them, and where it is duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, doth not fail to introduce them.</p>
               <p>To begin (as is but meet) with that, which hath the name of a <hi>Death unto ſin,</hi> becauſe ſin muſt be firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd, before the contrary quality can be introduc'd; Where firſt I will enquire what we are to underſtand by it, and then what evidence there is of the ſign of Baptiſm's being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to convey it.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding the former whereof we are to know, that as Men by the corruption of their nature are inclined unto ſin, and yet more by the irregularity of their converſations, ſo thoſe inclinations are to the perſons in whom they are, as a principle of life to a living Creature, and accordingly do both diſpoſe them to act ſutably thereto, and make them brisk, and vigorous in it. Now as it cannot well be expected, that where ſuch inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions prevail, Men ſhould purſue thoſe things, which piety, and vertue prompt them to, ſo it was the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Philoſophy firſt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Religion, if not wholly to deſtroy thoſe inclinations, yet at leaſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:36048:126"/>to ſubdue them in ſuch ſort, that they ſhould be in a manner dead, and the perſons, in whom they were, ſo far forth dead alſo; They neither finding in themſelves the like inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to actual ſin, nor hurried on by them, when they did. How little able Philoſophy was to contribute to ſo bleſſed an effect is not my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to ſhew, nor indeed will there be any need of it, after what I have elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed. Art. <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </note> ſaid concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the divine Grace in order to it. But as Chriſtianity doth every where pretend to the doing of it, and (which is more) both repreſents that effect under the name of a <hi>death unto ſin,</hi> and compares Men's thus dying with that natural death, which our Saviour underwent, ſo it may the more reaſonably pretend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it, becauſe it alſo pretends to furniſh Men with the power of his Grace, to which ſuch an effect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppos'd to be diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate. The only thing in queſtion as to our preſent concernment is, whether as the outward work of Baptiſm hath undoubtedly the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſign unto it, ſo it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:36048:126"/>the relation of a <hi>means</hi> fitted by God for the conveying of it, and what evidence there is of that relation.</p>
               <p>Now there are two ſorts of Texts, which bear witneſs to this relation, as well as to its having that more confeſſed relation of a ſign. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former entreat of this Grace under the title of a <hi>death unto ſin,</hi> the latter of a <hi>cleanſing</hi> from it. Of the former ſort I reckon that well known place to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only ſuppoſe all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 6.2.</note> to be <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly argue from it the unfitneſs of their <hi>living any longer</hi> therein, but affirm <hi>all, that are baptized into Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6.3.</note>, <hi>to be baptized into</hi> that <hi>death,</hi> yea to be <hi>buried by Baptiſm</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 6.4,</note> 
                  <hi>into it; to be planted together</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 6.5,</note> by that means <hi>in the likeneſs of Chriſts death,</hi> and to have <hi>their old Man</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note>, or the body of ſin crucified with him. For ſhall we ſay that S. <hi>Paul</hi> meant no more by all this, than that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Baptiſm, and the ſeveral parts of it was to repreſent to us the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our dying, and being buried as to ſin, and that accordingly all, that are baptized into Chriſt, make
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:36048:127"/>profeſſion of their reſolution ſo to do, but not that they are indeed buried by Baptiſm as to that particular. But beſide that we are not lightly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the propriety of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe, which muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd rather to favour a real death, than the bare ſignification of it; That Apoſtle doth moreover affirm thoſe, whom he before deſcrib'd as <hi>dead,</hi> to be <hi>freed</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note> 
                  <hi>from ſin,</hi> yea ſo far<note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note> as to have paſſed over into another <hi>ſervice,</hi> even that of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and to have <hi>obeyed from the heart</hi>

                  <hi>that form of Doctrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they had been delivered.</hi> Which ſuppos'd (as it may, becauſe the direct affirmation of S. <hi>Paul</hi>) will make that death, whereof we ſpeak, to be a death in reality, as well as in figure, and accordingly (becauſe Men are affirmed to be <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> into it) ſhew that Baptiſm to be a means of conveying it, as well as a repreſentation of it. Agreeable hereto, or rather yet more expreſs is that of the ſame Apoſtle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Col. 2.11.</note> though varying a little from the other, as to the manner of expreſſion. For having affirmed them
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:36048:127"/>through Chriſt to <hi>have put off the body of the ſins of the fleſh by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion not made with hands,</hi> and conſequently by a ſpiritual one, he yet adds (leſt any ſhould fancy that ſpiritual Circumciſion to accrue to them without ſome ceremonial one) in the <hi>Circumciſion of Chriſt,</hi> even that <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which, conformably to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their entrance into his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by, and wherein he accordingly affirms, as he did in the former place, that they were not only <hi>buried with him,</hi> but had <hi>riſen together with him by the faith of the operation of God, who raiſed him from the dead.</hi> From whence as it is clear, that the <hi>putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh</hi> (which is but another expreſſion for a death unto them) is though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by a ſpiritual Grace, yet by ſuch a one, as is conveyed to us by Baptiſm, ſo it becomes yet more clear by what he adds concerning Men's <hi>riſing with him</hi> in the ſame Baptiſm, even to a life contrary to what they had before depoſited, <hi>through the faith of the operation of God.</hi> For as we cannot conceive of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:36048:128"/>that <hi>riſing with Chriſt</hi> as other than a real one, becauſe there would not otherwiſe have needed ſuch a <hi>faith,</hi> as that, to bring it about; So neither therefore but think the like of that <hi>death,</hi> which it preſuppoſeth, and conſequently that that Baptiſm, to which it is annex'd, is a means of conveying it, as well as a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. But ſo we may be yet more convinc'd by ſuch Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as ſpeak of this <hi>death unto ſin</hi> under the notion of a <hi>cleanſing from it.</hi> Of which nature is that ſo often alledged one<note n="(h)" place="margin">Eph. 5.26, 27.</note> concerning Chriſt's <hi>ſanctifying, and cleanſing his Church with the waſhing of water by the word.</hi> For as it appears from what is afterwards ſubjoyn'd as the end of that <hi>cleanſing,</hi> even that the Church <hi>might not have any ſpot, or wrinkle, but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh;</hi> As it appears, I ſay, from thence, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the verſe before concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>cleanſing from the filth of ſin,</hi> which is but another expreſſion for <hi>the putting off the body of ſin,</hi> or a <hi>death</hi> unto it; So it appears in like manner from S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:36048:128"/>that <hi>cleanſing</hi> to the <hi>waſhing of water,</hi> that the outward ſign of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is by the appointment, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of God, a means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſpiritual Grace, by which that cleanſing is more immediately effected, and that death unto ſin procur'd.</p>
               <p>From that <hi>death unto ſin</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs we to our <hi>new birth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> that other inward, and ſpiritual Grace of Baptiſm, and the complement of the former. A Grace of whoſe conveyance by Baptiſm we can much leſs doubt, if we conſider the language of the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, or the Doctrine, as well as practice of the Church; The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the <hi>Jews</hi> had of that, which ſeems to have been its type, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar, or the expreſſions even of the Heathen concerning it.</p>
               <p>For what leſs can the Scripture be thought to mean, when it affirms us to be <hi>born of the water</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> of it, as well as <hi>of the ſpirit,</hi> yea ſo, as to be as truly <hi>ſpirit</hi>

For theſe expreſſions ſhew plainly enough, that Baptiſm hath its ſhare in the producing of this new birth, as well as the efficacy of God's Spirit; And conſequently that it is at leaſt the conveyer of that Grace, by which it is more immediately produc'd.</p>
               <p>And indeed as, if men would come without prejudice, they would ſoon ſee enough in thoſe <hi>expreſſions</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of as much as I have deduced from them; So they might ſee yet more (if they paſs'd ſo far) in the <hi>doctrine,</hi> and <hi>language</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to confirm them in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:36048:129"/>of them. For who ever even of the firſt, and pureſt times ſpake in a lower ſtrain concerning Baptiſm? who ever made leſs of it, than of a means, by which we are regenerated? I appeal for a proof hereof to their ſo <hi>unanimouſly</hi>

I appeal farther to the particular declarations of ſome of the moſt eminent among them, and which whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly conſider, will wonder how it ſhould come to fall back to a naked, and ineffectual ſign.

But of all the Antient Fathers, that have entreated of this affair, or indeed of that Sacrament, which we are now upon the conſideration of, there is no one, who hath ſpoken more, or more to the purpoſe than S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or whoſe words therefore will be
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:36048:131"/>more fit to conſider. Only, that I may not multiply teſtimonies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity, I will content my ſelf with one ſingle one, but which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the fulneſs thereof will ſerve inſtead of many, and be moreover as clear a teſtimony of our <hi>dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin</hi> by Baptiſm, as of our <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> by it. For <hi>when</hi> (ſaith he<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Epiſt. ad Donat.</note>) <hi>I lay in darkneſs, and under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the Night; When uncertain and doubtful I floated on the Sea of this toſſing World, ignorant of my own life, and as great a ſtranger to truth, I thought it exceeding difficult, as the manners of Men then were, that any one ſhould be born again, as the divine mercy had promis'd, and that being animated to a new life by the laver of ſalutary water, he ſhould put off that which he was before, and whilſt the frame of his body continu'd the ſame, become a new Man in his heart, and mind. For how</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>is it poſſible, that that ſhould be ſuddenly put off, which either being natural is now grown hard by the natural ſituation of the matter, or contracted by a long cuſtom hath been improv'd by old Age,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To theſe, and the like purpoſes I often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:36048:131"/>with my ſelf; For as I was at that time entangled with many errours of my former life, which I did not then think it was poſſible for me to put off; So I willingly gave obedience to thoſe vices, that ſtuck to me, and through a deſpair of better things, I favour'd my evils, as though they had been my proper, and domeſtick ones. But after that through the aſſiſtance of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating water the blemiſhes of my former life were waſh'd off, and my mind thus purged had a light from above pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it; After that the ſecond birth had chang'd me into a new Man through the force of that ſpirit, or breath, which I ſuck'd in from above; Then thoſe things, which were before doubtful, became exceeding certain, and manifeſt; things, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhut, were then laid open, and dark things made light. Then that, which before ſeemed difficult, appear'd to help, rather than hinder, and that, which ſometime was thought impoſſible, as poſſible to be done. So that it was not difficult to diſcern, that that was earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which being carnally born did before live obnoxious to faults, and that that began to be God's, which the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:36048:132"/>now animated. You your ſelf verily know, and will as readily acknowledge with me, what was either taken from, or beſtow'd upon us by that death of crimes, and life of vertues.</hi> Which as it is an illuſtrious teſtimony of the force of Baptiſm in this particular, and with what reaſon we have affirm'd it to be a means of procuring the former <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>birth;</hi> So I have the more willingly taken notice of it, becauſe it comes ſo near even in its expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to what our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Grace</hi> thereof: There being no great difference between <hi>a death of crimes, and life of vertues,</hi> which is the expreſſion of that <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>a death unto ſin, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> which is the <hi>other's.</hi> And I ſhall only add, that as the Doctrine of the Church muſt therefore be thought to bear ſufficient teſtimony to Baptiſm's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>means</hi> of our <hi>regeneration;</hi> So its practice is in this particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to its Doctrine, and though in another way proclaims the ſame thing.

               <p>And indeed as it is hard to believe, that it ought to be otherwiſe eſteem'd, conſidering what hath been alledg'd either from Scripture, or the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Church; So it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be yet harder, if we conſider the opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning that, which may ſeem to have been both it's <hi>Type,</hi> and <hi>exemplar.</hi> For as I have made it appear before<note n="(w)" place="margin">Part 1.</note>, that even they were not without their Baptiſm, and ſuch a one, as was moreover intended for the ſame
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:36048:133"/>general ends, for which both their <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was, and our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is; So I have made it appear alſo<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, that the perſons ſo baptiz'd among them were accounted as perſons new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, yea ſo far, that after that time they were <hi>not to own any of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer relations;</hi> In fine, that that new birth was look'd upon as ſo ſingular, that it gave occaſion to their <hi>Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtical</hi> Doctors to teach, that the old ſoul of the Baptized Proſelyte vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and a new one ſucceeded in its place. For if this was the condition of that <hi>Type</hi> of Chriſtian Baptiſm, how much more of the Antitype thereof? Eſpecially when it is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther probable (as hath been alſo<note n="(y)" place="margin">Part 2.</note> noted from the diſcourſe of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to <hi>Nicodemus</hi>) that he both allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it to that Baptiſm of theirs, and intimated the conformity of his own Baptiſm to it in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>

                     <hi>The Contents.</hi> Of the relation of the ſign of Baptiſm to our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to the Church, and that relation ſhewn to be no leſs than that of a <hi>means,</hi> whereby that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is made. This evidenc'd in the <hi>firſt</hi> place from the declarations of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> more particularly from its affirming all Chriſtians to be baptiz'd <hi>into</hi> that <hi>Body,</hi> as thoſe, who were firſt baptiz'd after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, to have been thereby <hi>added</hi> to their company, and made <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi> with the reſt <hi>in the</hi> Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip, in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread, and in Prayers. The like evidence of the ſame <hi>Union to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:36048:135"/>the Church</hi> by Baptiſm from the declarations of the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>conſequences</hi> of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſhewn to be ſuch, as to make that alſo to be accounted one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpiritual Graces of that Baptiſm, by which it is made.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus given an account of ſuch inward, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Graces of Baptiſm, as tend more immediately to our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and eternal welfare; It remains that I ſay ſomewhat of that, which though of no ſuch immediate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, yet is not without all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe qualifying us for the reception of the other: That <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> I mean, which we thereby obtain to Chriſt's myſtical <hi>body</hi> the Church, and by which we, who were before Aliens from it, as well as from God, and Chriſt, become members of the Church, and partakers of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral priviledges thereof. Which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> if any Man ſcruple to reckon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the inward, and ſpiritual Graces of Baptiſm properly ſo call'd, I will not contend with him about it; Provided he alſo allow of it as a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:36048:135"/>thing ſignified by it on the part of God, and Chriſt, and as moreover a Grace, and favour to the perſon, on whom it is beſtow'd. For as that is all I ask at preſent concerning the Union now in queſtion; So what I farther mean by it's being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpiritual Grace ſhall be clear'd in the proceſs of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and receive that eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which it requires. In order whereunto I will ſhew the outward and viſible ſign of Baptiſm to be a <hi>means,</hi> whereby that Union is made, and then point out the <hi>conſequences</hi> of that Union.</p>
               <p>That the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm is in the nature of a <hi>means, whereby we are united to the Church,</hi> will appear if we reflect upon what the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath ſaid concerning it; or the agreeing declarations of the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf. For what elſe (to begin with the former) can S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> be thought to mean, where he affirms all whether <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> or of what ever other outward differences, to have been <hi>baptiz</hi>'d <hi>by one ſpirit into one body?</hi> For as it is plain from the foregoing<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> verſe,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:36048:136"/>or verſes, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> entreats of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the baptizing here ſpoken of muſt be meant of our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing into it;</hi> So it is alike plain from what it was deſigned to prove, as well as from the natural force of the expreſſion, that it was ſet to denote alſo our being <hi>united</hi> to it thereby. For as we cannot impoſe a more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe upon <hi>Baptized into that body,</hi> than our being receiv'd by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm into it, as the Baptized perſon is within the water, and conſeqent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome way united to it; So much leſs if we conſider what it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prove, even<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, how many ſoever, are but that <hi>one body.</hi> For how doth their being <hi>baptiz'd into it</hi> prove them to be that one Body, but that that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign, by which they are ſo, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes them to one another, and to the whole? A <hi>meer</hi> ſign of Union, though it may ſhew what the partakers thereof ought to be, yet being no juſt proof of what they are, and much leſs (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue) that they are ſo by the means of it. And indeed, as it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:36048:136"/>be hard to make the ſign here ſpoken of to be any thing leſs than a means of our Union to the Church; So eſpecially, if we conſider what is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid concerning thoſe, who firſt after the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, were baptized in the name of Chriſt: S. <hi>Luke</hi> not only affirming of thoſe new baptiz'd ones, that they were <hi>added to</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note> the Apoſtles, and their other company, (which he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 2.47.</note> by <hi>added to the Church</hi>) but that they were partakers<note n="(c)" place="margin">Acts 2.42.</note> with the reſt in the <hi>Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in Prayers.</hi> For this ſhews their having an intereſt in all the priviledges of that Body, and therefore much more their being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it. But ſo it appears that the Antient Church eſteemed of it, whoſe determination is of the more force, becauſe it is only about the ſuppoſed means of Union to its own Body; <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> after he had ſpoken of the baptizing of ſuch as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd themſelves to the Chriſtian Church (which he himſelf expreſſeth, when ſo baptiz'd, by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>conjoyned with themſelves</hi>)
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:36048:137"/>affirming that <hi>they were immediately brought where the brethren were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> there to partake with them of the <hi>common Prayers,</hi> that were then offer'd up, of the <hi>kiſs of peace,</hi> and of the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> Which laſt particular I have the more confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented the new baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as then admitted to, becauſe the ſame Father doth not only make no diſtinction between them, and the other brethren in it, though he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the buſineſs of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to the former Prayers, and <hi>kiſs of peace,</hi> but affirms the ſame Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt preſently after to be <hi>lawful to none to partake of, but thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd</hi> their Doctrine, receiv'd the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of regeneration,</hi> and <hi>liv'd as Chriſt delivered.</hi> For as he intimates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the admiſſion of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and were baptiz'd, if they were alſo ſuch as liv'd as Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, which the new baptized were in reaſon to be accounted, till they had given proof to the contrary; So there is reaſon to believe from the uſe of <hi>Excommunication</hi> in the Church, that that addition of <hi>living as Chriſt deliver'd</hi> was not made to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:36048:137"/>bar the new baptized from it, till they gave farther proof of ſuch a life, but to intimate the excluſion of thoſe, who, after they had been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, liv'd otherwiſe, than Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity preſcrib'd: So making the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons excluded the <hi>unbaptiz'd,</hi> or <hi>ill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians,</hi> and conſequently the contrary thereto admitted. I deny not indeed, that the Rite of <hi>Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> did very antiently come between the receiving of Baptiſm, and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. I deny not farther, becauſe of what was before<note n="(d)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacrament in general. Part 4.</note> quoted from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> concerning the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prayer</hi> that was made for the new baptized perſon, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof was then in uſe, even <hi>prayer for grace for him</hi> to live as he had but now profeſs'd. But as the deſign of Confirmation appears to have been to procure for the new baptiz'd a more plentiful effuſion of God's Graces, which is no intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all of his having been before no perfect Chriſtian, or not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly united to the Church, ſo Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm may for all that be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the means of our Union to the Church, which is all, that I have
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:36048:138"/>taken upon me to aſſert. For the farther evidencing whereof I will in the next place alledge a paſſage of <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">De Bapt. c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note>, which will, though not ſo directly, prove the ſame thing; That I mean where he ſaith, that <hi>when the profeſſion of our faith, and ſponſion of our ſalvation are pledged under the three witneſſes</hi> before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>there is neceſſarily added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mention of the Church, becauſe where thoſe three are, even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, there is alſo the Church, which is the body of the Three.</hi> For as it is evident from thence, that Men were even from his time baptiz'd expreſly into the belief of the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belief of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> So it will not be difficult to inferr, that they were alſo baptiz'd into the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, and made members of the Church by it: Becauſe as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the <hi>Trinity</hi> to become Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of our Salvation in Baptiſm, as well as either Witneſſes, or objects of our Profeſſion; So he affirms thoſe Sponſors to be as it were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyed in the Church, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exert their ſaving influences

And indeed, though in that form, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour preſcrib'd<note n="(f)" place="margin">Matt 28.19.</note> for Baptiſm, there is mention only of baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, yet inaſmuch as he preſcrib'd that very form for the <hi>making of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus conſider'd the things ſignified by Baptiſm <hi>on the part of God, and Chriſt,</hi> beſt known by the name of its <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpiritual Graces;</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that I give the like account of the things ſignified by it on the part of the baptiz'd, or <hi>the things the baptized perſon maketh Profeſſion of by it.</hi> Which, as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, are an <hi>Abrenunciation of ſin,</hi> a <hi>preſent belief of the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> and <hi>a reſolution for the time to come to continue in that belief, and act agreeably to its Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſomething is ſignified by Baptiſm on the part of the <hi>baptized,</hi> as well as on the part of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is evident from what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in general, Part 2.</note> concerning the nature of a <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the general, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm's<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note> relating as well to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be perform'd by the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, as to thoſe divine Graces, or
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:36048:141"/>priviledges which we expect from the other.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>things</hi> before mentioned are the things thus ſignified by it, hath alſo been elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">Expl. of the Apoſties Creed.</note> declar'd, and ſo, that it would not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for a diligent Reader to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf from thence. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what I have ſaid concerning them lies diſperſedly in my former Diſcourſes, and would therefore require more pains, than I ought to impoſe upon my Reader, to find it out, and apply it to the preſent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; I will here, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefly, conſider them anew, and if not (which would be too tedious) repeat all that I have ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, yet point him as I go to the particular places, from whence they may be fetch'd.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Abrenunciation of ſin</hi> is one of the things ſignified by Baptiſm is not only evident from the manner of adminiſtring it in the Primitive times, and which together with the form of their Abrenunciation, and our own are ſet down in my account of the <hi>Preliminary queſtions, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> of the Catechiſm, but alſo from
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:36048:142"/>the general tenour of that Religion, which Baptiſm is an initiation into; That requiring the renouncing of all ſin, and wickedneſs, and therefore ſuppoſing the baptized perſon to do ſo, when he takes that Religion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. For which cauſe as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Abrenunciation was heretofore requir'd, and continues ſo to be to this very day; So it was ſignified, as by other Rites, and particularly by the baptized perſons <hi>putting off his cloaths</hi> in order to his Baptiſm, as putting off together with them the <hi>Old Man,</hi> and <hi>his deeds,</hi> ſo by the Rite of Baptiſm it ſelf: He, who ſubmits to that, implying thereby his looking upon <hi>ſin</hi> as a Moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, and which therefore for the future he would not have any thing to do with.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing ſignified by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm on the part of the baptized is his <hi>preſent belief of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity,</hi> more eſpecially of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> As is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from that Baptiſm's being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by our Saviour to be made <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:36048:142"/>For to be baptiz'd <hi>into the name</hi> of thoſe perſons importing the owning of thoſe perſons as our <hi>Maſters</hi>

                  </note>, and our ſelves as the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of them; To be ſo baptized moreover importing the owning of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as <hi>alike</hi>

                  <hi>Maſters</hi> of us, and conſequently, becauſe the Father can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be own'd in any lower relation, as partakers of the ſame divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Authority; Laſtly, to be ſo baptiz'd importing the owning of them in particular by a <hi>belief</hi> of the Chriſtian Doctrine, that being the moſt ſignal inſtance of that Diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we receive by it; The belief of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in particular muſt be look'd upon as ſignified by Baptiſm on the part of the baptized, and thoſe baptized ones conſequently as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king profeſſion of that belief by it. For which cauſe as the <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Creed</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Introd. concerning Catechiſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> was given to thoſe to learn, who were willing to be initiated into Chriſtianity, ſo they were particularly interrogated<note n="(d)" place="margin">Expl. of the Prel.

               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:36048:143"/>
               <p> The third and laſt thing ſignified on the part of the baptized is a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for the time to come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the belief of Chriſtianity, and act agreeably to its Laws.</hi> Both which will receive a ſufficient confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s affirming Baptiſm to be the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> or <hi>ſtipulation of a good conſcience toward God,</hi> and from what I have elſewhere<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſaid concerning it. For as it is evident from thence, that Baptiſm ſignifies on the part of the baptized a ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or promiſe of ſomewhat to be done by him; So it will not be difficult to inferr from thence, that it ſignifies alſo a ſtipulation, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to continue in that belief of Chriſtianity, into which he is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, and act agreeably to its laws. As will appear, whether we conſider that ſtipulation as having <hi>a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience toward God</hi> for the object of it (in which ſenſe I ſhould think S. <hi>Peter</hi> ought to be underſtood) or, as I find many others to do, as <hi>proceeding from ſuch a conſcience.</hi> For a <hi>good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> having a due regard to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of that Religion, which it makes profeſſion to eſpouſe; He,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:36048:143"/>who with relation to Chriſtianity ſtipulates <hi>from a good conſcience,</hi> or makes that good conſoience the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his ſtipulation, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be thought to ſtipulate, or make a promiſe of anſwering the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of it, and therefore alſo (becauſe they are parts of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) of continuing in its Faith, and acting agreeably to its Laws. And hence, (as was before<note n="(f)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in general, Part 1.</note> obſerv'd) this, and the other Inſtitution of our Religion had of old the name of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> as importing a Vow, or promiſe to Chriſt of believing in him, or obeying him. And hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the Antients argued<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> the <hi>unlawfulneſs of ſuperinducing an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> or military <hi>Sacrament upon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine one,</hi> and <hi>anſwering to another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter after Chriſt.</hi> Which we ſhall the leſs need to wonder at, if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that that Baptiſm, whereof we ſpeak, was copyed from the Baptiſm of the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Expl. of Baptiſm, Part 1.</note>, and particularly from that of <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former of theſe it hath been obſerv'd<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, that <hi>thoſe three men, that preſided over it, lean'd over the baptized perſons as they ſtood in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:36048:144"/>the water, and twice explain'd to them ſome of the more weighty, and lighter precepts of their Law.</hi> For what reaſon think we, but to let them know, that they were baptiz'd into the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the one, and the other, and that they accounted that Baptiſm of their's as a Profeſſion of it? And though we do not find the like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd concerning the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> which becauſe an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary one, and immediately <hi>from Heaven,</hi> I have diſtinguiſhed from the other; Yet, which will come all to one, we find it entituled the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Repentance</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Mark 1.4. Acts 13.14.</note>, and (which is more) that Baptiſt enjoining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe <hi>Publicans</hi>
                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">Luk. 3.12, &amp;c.</note>, who came to be baptized by him, <hi>to exact no more than was appointed them,</hi> as upon thoſe <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that came upon the like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, <hi>to do violence to no man, to accuſe no man falſly, and to be content with their wages:</hi> Such affirmations as theſe being pregnant proofs, that a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of living piouſly, and vertuouſly was a thing ſignified on the part of the baptized, and that their taking upon them the former Baptiſms was a profeſſion of it. Now if that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:36048:144"/>were the intendment of the former Baptiſms, and particularly of that of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> why not alſo of the Baptiſm of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, when <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm of <hi>Repentance</hi> was to prepare men for the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and to which therefore we may ſuppoſe a ſtricter piety to belong, and they, who were baptiz'd into that Kingdom, plung'd more deeply into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the other. I will conclude this affair, when I have added, that it appears from the Inſtitution of Baptiſm, that the deſign, and end of it was to make Diſciples<note n="(m)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. For it appearing from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words of his, that they, and they alone can be his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> who <hi>take up their Croſs</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Luk. 14.27.</note>, <hi>and follow him, forſake all</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Luk. 14.33.</note> 
                  <hi>for him,</hi> and in fine <hi>abide</hi> 
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Joh. 8.31.</note> 
                  <hi>in his words;</hi> If the deſign, and end of Baptiſm were to make men Diſciples unto Chriſt, it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently oblige thoſe, who take it upon them, to take upon them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the performance of the other, as to which that Diſcipleſhip obligeth them.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:36048:145"/>
               <p> Now though therefore there can be no great doubt concerning the baptized perſon's making profeſſion of acting agreeably to the Laws of Chriſt, yet there may be as to the meaſure of that conformity to them, to which his Baptiſmal Profeſſion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him; That imperfect ſtate, wherein we are, and the baptized perſon's being from the beginning<note n="(q)" place="margin">Expl. of the Lords Prayer in the words, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</note> taught to pray <hi>for the forgiveneſs of his Treſpaſſes</hi> ſeeming to require an abatement of it; And becauſe too I have more than once oblig'd my ſelf to enquire, what <hi>keeping of God's holy Will, and Commandments,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us from our Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Profeſſion, and that Chriſtianity, which it enters us into; Therefore for the farther clearing this part of our Baptiſmal Profeſſion, as well as for the anſwering my own obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I will now ſet my ſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what the <hi>meaſure</hi> of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is, which we <hi>profeſs</hi> to pay to the Laws of Chriſt, and what are the <hi>conſequences of the violation of that Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As concerning the <hi>former</hi> of theſe I ſhall not doubt to affirm it to be
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:36048:145"/>adaequate for the matter of it to the ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> of thoſe Laws, which Chriſtianity obligeth us to; S. <hi>Paul</hi> having expreſly told us<note n="(r)" place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12.</note>, that that <hi>Grace, which bringeth ſalvation, teacheth men to deny all ungodly, and worldly luſts, and to live righteouſly, godlily and ſoberly in the preſent World.</hi> I ſhall not ſtick to affirm, Secondly, that that Conformity, which we make profeſſion of, ought to anſwer ſo far as we can carry it, the ſeveral <hi>particularities</hi> of the Chriſtian Laws, as well as the ſeveral ſpecies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Leſs than that being not to be ſuppos'd to be the Profeſſion of thoſe, who make profeſſion of a good Conſcience toward God; A good Conſcience, as ſuch, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in whom it is to conform ſo far as he can to every particular of his Law, to whom he profeſſeth an obedience. But neither Thirdly ſhall I ſtick to affirm, that that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which we make profeſſion of, ought to be ſo entire, and full, as not to be interrupted at any time by a <hi>wilful violation</hi> of any Law, or a violation of them in <hi>ſcandalous inſtances;</hi> Such as thoſe are, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Such I take to be the Conformity, which Chriſtianity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us to, and which conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the baptized perſon muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to make profeſſion of. And I would to God, that as all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans make profeſſion of ſuch a one, ſo their lives, and converſations were more anſwerable to it, than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience both of our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſures us it is. But as the contrary thereof is too apparent to need any farther proof, ſo I think it therefore but reaſonable, for the better awaking of thoſe baptized ones, to ſet before them in the next place the <hi>conſequences of the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereof the firſt, that I ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, is, that ſo far as they depart from that Profeſſion of theirs, ſo far
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:36048:146"/>forth they ſin againſt that very Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of theirs, which was intended for their recovery from ſin, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſaving Religion, into which it admits them: That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which enjoyns upon them the making profeſſion of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, enjoyning conſequently the anſwering that profeſſion by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table piety, as without which that Profeſſion would be but an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical one. From whence as it will follow, that there will be little reaſon to believe, that they ſhall enjoy the benefits of Baptiſm, who anſwer not the Profeſſion of it; So much leſs if we conſider what that was, that made their Profeſſion to be of any avail at the firſt, even the <hi>preſumption</hi> it gave, that the perſon, that made it, would (as occaſion offer'd it ſelf) give ſutable demonſtrations of it. For if that preſumption were the thing, which made the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a good Conſcience to be of any avail at the firſt; Thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations failing, thoſe benefits muſt be ſuppos'd to fail, which were collated upon the preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. But from thence it
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:36048:147"/>will follow Thirdly, that they, who anſwer not their former profeſſion, can much leſs promiſe to themſelves farther ſpiritual bleſſings here, or an intereſt in the other World; They, who could not be admitted to the firſt priviledges of Baptiſm but upon a preſumption of their future piety, being much leſs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be admitted to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of others, after that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption appeareth to be null. It will follow Laſtly, that they who anſwer not the Profeſſion of Baptiſm by a piety ſutable to it, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fail altogether of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof, if that Chriſtianity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it entred them, had not provided them of a remedy againſt the violations of their Profeſſion.

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Contents.</hi> After a ſhort account of the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Baptiſmal relation, and reference made to thoſe places from which a larger one may be fetch'd; Enquiry is made touching the right Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in again Firſt, Whether Baptiſm ought expreſly to be made in the name of the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, Secondly whether Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Hereticks are valid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtratours of it, Thirdly, to what, and what kind of perſons it ought to be adminiſtred, Fourthly, Whether it may be repeated. The two firſt of theſe ſpoken to here,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:36048:149"/>and firſt, Whether Baptiſm ought to be expreſly adminiſtred in the form propos'd. Which is not only ſhewn to be under obligation from the expreſs words of the Inſtitution, but anſwer made to thoſe Texts, which ſeem to intimate it to be enough to baptize in the name of the Lord Jeſus only. The Baptiſm of Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks more largely ſhewn to be valid, unleſs where they baptize into a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <hi>Faith,</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> againſt it anſwer'd.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have hitherto entreated of the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible ſign</hi> of Baptiſm, of its <hi>inward and ſpiritual Grace,</hi> or the things ſignified by it, and the <hi>farther relation</hi> that outward ſign beareth to them. It follows that I entreat of the <hi>foundation</hi> of that relation, the <hi>Fourth</hi> thing propos'd to be conſider'd.</p>
               <p>Now as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of that relation hath been ſhewn<note n="*" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacrament in general, Part 2.</note> to be no other, than the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, as that again not ſo much as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by him, as appli'd to that <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in which it is ſubjected; So I have in the ſame diſcourſe ſaid<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> Part 2, 3.</note> ſo
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:36048:149"/>much concerning the Inſtitution of this, and the application of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to the outward viſible ſign thereof, that I ſhall need to ſay the leſs here. It may ſuffice briefly to obſerve from thence, that when the Miniſter hath prepar'd the water of Baptiſm by a declaration of the end of its Inſtitution, and by imploring the Holy Spirit on it, Chriſt, who hath promiſed to be with him in that miniſtration of his, gives it the relation of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and conſequently makes it apt to convey the ſeveral graces thereof to thoſe, who are to partake of it. Which will leave little more for us to conſider, as to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, than the right Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, or what may without any violence be reduced to it.</p>
               <p>Now there are <hi>Four</hi> things, which are eſpecially to be enquir'd in order to the clearing of that, which is now before us.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. Whether Baptiſm ought expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be adminiſter'd in the name of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                  <item>II. Whether Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks are valid Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of it.</item>
                  <item>III. To what, and what kind of perſons it ought to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred.</item>
                  <item>IV. Whether it may be repeated.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. The ground of the firſt of theſe, even whether Baptiſm ought expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be adminiſtred <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is not any the leaſt doubt of thoſe being the expreſs words of the Inſtitution, or of their not admitting, conſider'd in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of any variation from it, but the accounts we have from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the adminiſtration of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament either by the hands, or at the command of the Apoſtles, and other ſuch inſpired men: Thoſe ſeeeming to intimate it to be enough to baptize <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as comprehending within it an acknowledgement of the other two perſons, and indeed of all other the ſubſtantial Articles of his Faith, in whoſe name we are ſo baptiz'd. For thus when thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:36048:150"/>S. <hi>Peter</hi> Preach'd on the day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,</hi> were wrought upon ſo far, as to ask what they ought to do in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Salvation; S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was<note n="†" place="margin">Acts 2.38.</note> that they ſhould be <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd in the name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> Which accordingly we may believe to have been done by thoſe, that <hi>gladly receiv'd the word,</hi> becauſe it is afterwards<note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note> ſaid of them, that <hi>they were baptiz'd,</hi> that is, as one would think, in that, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name, which had been preſcrib'd. Thus again it is ſaid<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 8.16.</note> of thoſe, who had been baptiz'd by <hi>Philip</hi> at <hi>Samaria,</hi> that they were <hi>baptiz'd in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> without any the leaſt hint of their being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in any <hi>other name:</hi> As in like manner<note n="(c)" place="margin">Acts 10.47.</note>, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> gave order for the baptizing of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his company, after that the Holy Ghoſt had by his preaching deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them. In fine thus we find, that the Diſciples of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Acts 19.5.</note> were, who it ſeems till that time had not only no gifts of the Holy Ghoſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but not ſo much as any knowledge, whether there were any Holy Ghoſt, or no. Which place is
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:36048:151"/>the more to be ſtood upon, becauſe thoſe Diſciples having before ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knowledge of a Holy Ghoſt, one would think he that told the ſtory of their taking upon them the Chriſtian Baptiſm at the hearing of what was ſaid to them by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſhould have expreſs'd that Baptiſm of theirs by their being baptiz'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belief of the Trinity, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of that <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which they ſeem before to have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of. But as we are not lightly to think, nor indeed without an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refiagable reaſon, that thoſe firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt made uſe of, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd any other form of Baptiſm, than what their Maſter had ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and expreſly preſcrib'd; So there is nothing of any ſuch moment in the places before alledg'd to perſuade their making uſe of, or giving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to any other. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Text laſt mention'd, if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in all its parts, ſeems rather to perſuade thoſe Diſciples having been baptiz'd in the very words of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, than only <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> For S. <hi>Paul</hi> asking, as by way of wonderment, unto
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:36048:151"/>what they had been before baptiz'd, if they had not (as they ſaid) ſo much as heard of any Holy Ghoſt, ſeems to intimate that all, that then receiv'd the Chriſtian Baptiſm, could not but know from the very form of it, that there was ſuch a thing as a Holy Ghoſt. Neither will it avail to ſay, as was before objected, that if that had been S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s intention, or the certain form of Baptiſm, S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who tells the ſtory, ſhould in reaſon have expreſs'd it by their being baptiz'd into the Trinity, and particularly into the name of him, whom they were before ſo ignorant of. Becauſe S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s buſineſs was not ſo much to give an account of the form of their Baptiſm, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us, that whereas before they had been only baptiz'd into <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, upon their underſtanding from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> himſelf dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thoſe, that came to it, <hi>to believe on him that ſhould come after him, that is on Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> they were then expreſly baptiz'd into the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Chriſt, or (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> there expreſſeth it) into the name of Jeſus Chriſt: So oppoſing the baptizing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:36048:152"/>
                  <hi>into the name of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> not to the baptizing in any other form, and particularly into the name of all the three perſons, but to the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> only, and as the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> might diſcriminate their preſent Baptiſm from it. And though it be true, that the like is not to be ſaid as to the foregoing Texts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no oppoſition in them between the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and that of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yet may a fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be given, without ſuppoſing that to have been the form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, of the Scriptures expreſſing thoſe primitive Baptiſms by bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing into the <hi>name of Jeſus</hi> only; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Saviour was the immediate Author of that Religion, into which thoſe Baptiſms were made, and the baptizing <hi>into his name</hi> therefore no improper expreſſion of a baptizing into the whole of it, and into every part, and particle thereof. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this affair, when I have added that as it appears from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>

                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:36048:152"/>one of the Antienteſt Writers the Church hath, that Baptiſm was in his time adminiſtred in the name of the three perſons; So all, that have mentioned the Creed, have repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it as a thing given to thoſe, who were to be baptized, and into which therefore we are to think, that if men were not minutely, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly baptiz'd, yet they were at leaſt into the <hi>capital</hi> Articles thereof.</p>

But how little force there is in theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to the invalidating the Baptiſm of Schiſmaticks, or Hereticks, will appear upon a more narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into them.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:36048:153"/>
               <p> For be it firſt that Schiſmaticks and Hereticks are by that Schiſm, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of theirs deprived of the Spirit of God themſelves; Be it that they cannot therefore be ſuppos'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr it upon others: Yet will it not from thence follow, but they may be valid Adminiſtratours of Baptiſm, and they, who receive it from them, receive the Spirit of God with it. Becauſe that Spirit of God, which goes along with Baptiſm, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by them, but by him, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution Baptiſm is, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no way depending upon their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirit of God themſelves. All, that the Miniſter confers on his part toward the procuring of that Spirit, is to prepare that Baptiſmal Water, which it is by the Inſtitution of Chriſt to accompany, and to adminiſter it, when ſo prepar'd, to thoſe who are to be baptized with it. Which if the Miniſter doth according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, there is no doubt the Spirit of God will follow of courſe, whether he, who admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Baptiſm, partake of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or no. Otherwiſe a ſinful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter would be as invalid an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:36048:154"/>of Baptiſm, as the moſt Schiſmatical, or Heretical one.</p>
               <p>But it may be there is more of weight in Schiſmaticks, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks being <hi>out of the Church,</hi> and as ſuch in no condition either of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themſelves thoſe priviledges, that belong to it, or being inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal toward the procuring of them for others. And ſo no doubt there would, if they were fully, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Church, nor retain'd in any meaſure to it. But how firſt, if Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks were fully, and perfectly out of the Church, could S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Ad Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Ep. <hi>70.</hi>
                  </note> himſelf allow the receiving of ſuch without a new Baptiſm, who had after their Baptiſm in the Church fallen into Schiſm, or Hereſie? Theſe, as they were no leſs Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks than thoſe, that were baptiz'd by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and conſequently alike out of the Church; So being, if to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd again, to be receiv'd after the ſame manner, that is to ſay by a new Baptiſm. Neither will it avail to ſay (as that <hi>Father</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> pleads for himſelf) that thoſe, who have been baptiz'd in the Church, are to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:36048:154"/>be look'd upon as <hi>wandring ſheep,</hi> and as ſuch, when they return, to be receiv'd into the Fold, whereas the other are wholly <hi>aliens,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane.</hi> For if Schiſmaticks, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks be fully, and perfectly out of the Church, thoſe alſo, what ever they before were, muſt ceaſe to be look'd upon as Sheep, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if admitted, be admitted as <hi>aliens,</hi> and <hi>profane,</hi> as well as thoſe, who were baptiz'd out of the Church. And indeed as it appears by the ſame <hi>Father</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ad Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Ep. <hi>71.</hi>
                  </note>, that thoſe who oppos'd him, and the Biſhops that took part with him, argued the validity of the Baptiſm of Hereticks from the Churches receiving thoſe without a new one, who had fallen after her Baptiſm into Schiſm or Hereſie; So if we will allow the Baptiſm of the latter, we muſt allow the Baptiſm of the former, or find out ſome other reaſon to overthrow it. For if the rightly baptized Schiſmatick, or Heretick were a <hi>Sheep,</hi> though a <hi>wandring</hi> one, notwithſtanding his Schiſm, or Hereſie; The Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or Heretick, whom that <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Sheep</hi> ran after, might as well
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:36048:155"/>be a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> though a <hi>wandring</hi> one too, and conſequently be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, following the order of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, to bring new Sheep to the great Shepherd, and Biſhop of our Souls. That, which I ſuppoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd that <hi>Father</hi>'s miſtake (for ſo I hope I may now have leave to call it, becauſe the Church of God hath generally done ſo ſince) but that I ſay, which occaſion'd S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>'s miſtake, was his not diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing between being fully, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly out of the Church (which I ſhould think none but Apoſtates can be, if they alſo are) and being only partly, and imperfectly ſo, as Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and Hereticks are. For as Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks muſt be ſuppos'd to retain ſo far to the Church, as they do not ſeparate from it in Communion, or belief; So it is but a juſt piece of charity to think that Chriſt who knows men's infirmities, and prejudices, will not invalidate ſuch acts of theirs, as are purely charitable ones, and wherein moreover they conſent with the Church of God (whatever they may do as to other things) and with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:36048:155"/>his own bleſſed Inſtitution. I deny not indeed, but that to be even ſo out of the Church, as Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks are, is a very dangerous thing, and doth without a ſpecial mercy of God make them liable to Damnation. But as I do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think, that we ought to look upon it as a deſperate one; So there may be ſo much of honeſt ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind even in them, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to embrace the truth, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are convinced of it, that Chriſt, who laid down his life for the worſt of men, may ſo far at leaſt conſider them, as to give his bleſſing to thoſe acts of theirs, which are both charitable in themſelves, and manag'd with a juſt conſent to his own inſtitution, and the practice too of that Church, from which in other things they have departed.</p>
               <p>And this anſwer, with a little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, will furniſh one to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which repreſents Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Hereticks as <hi>ſinners</hi> before God, and whom therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe God will hear for the perſon to be baptiz'd. For though I grant that ſuch perſons are ſinners
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:36048:156"/>before God, yea that whatever they do by way of ſeparation from the Church is to be look'd upon as of the ſame nature, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that their very baptizing alſo may be; Yet as I do not think that every thing, that is ſinfully done, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore invalid (for ſo for ought I know many true Churchmens good actions alſo might be) So Chriſt may hear even ſuch perſons, when they act agreeably to his own Inſtitution, both for the regard he bears to that, and for that honeſt ſimplicity, and good meaning, which is, if not in them that adminiſter Baptiſm, yet in thoſe that joyn with them, and whoſe Miniſter I have before ſaid<note n="(h)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacram. ingen. Part. 3</note> the Conſecratour to be in that affair.</p>
               <p>One only Objection remains on the part of Hereticks, and that is their depraving that Faith, into which Baptiſm is requir'd to be made, and conſequently thereto, as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, baptizing into a falſe, and counterfeit one. And I no way doubt that, if Hereticks baptize into a falſe, and counterfeit Faith, their Baptiſm is null, becauſe contrary to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:36048:156"/>that Inſtitution, which gives validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all. Upon which account we muſt look upon the Baptiſm of thoſe perſons as null, who have baptiz'd in any other form, than in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. Of which ſort was that of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks ſpoken of by <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Adv. Haereſ. li. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi>

Which I do in part upon the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council<note n="(l)" place="margin">Can. 19.</note>, and in part alſo upon the Authority of Reaſon. For though there be not the leaſt preſumption, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> made uſe of any other form of Baptiſm, than the Catholicks did; Though there be ſome preſumption on the contrary, that they made uſe of the very ſame form, becauſe though they deny'd a Trinity of Perſons, yet they aſſerted one, and the ſame God to be rightly entitled by the names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; Yet did the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (becauſe of their direct,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:36048:158"/>and manifeſt denial of the Trinity, and their affirming Chriſt to be a meer Man) ſo far diſallow their Baptiſm, as to require the reiteration of it. As indeed why ſhould it not, when thoſe <hi>Paulianiſts</hi> did ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and manifeſtly contradict the ſenſe of that form, whereby they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to proceed? That direct, and manifeſt contradiction of theirs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming to the World, that though they baptiz'd in the ſame form of words with the Orthodox, yet in a perfectly different ſenſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently departed alike from that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which was to give force to it.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:36048:158"/>by their own, nor varying from the preſcribed form, as ſome other of them did, they may be reaſonably preſum'd to have left the form by them us'd to its proper ſenſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that was, and to what he, who preſcrib'd it, did intend it. Which ſuppos'd, what ſhould hinder Chriſt from giving force to that Baptiſm, which is ſo adminiſtred by them? Theſe, as they do not at all vary from the Inſtitution of Chriſt, ſo in this particular, even in the application of the Baptiſmal water to the Baptized parties, acting not in their own, or in their peoples names, but in the name of Chriſt, and who therefore may the rather be ſuppoſed to give force and vertue to it. The reſult of the premiſes is this. A Heretick is indeed oblig'd to baptize into the truly Chriſtian Faith, neither can any man otherwiſe promiſe force from that act of his. But if he baptize into that faith (as he may even whilſt he continues ſuch) his Baptiſm is valid, neither can any man doubt of a bleſſing from it, who comes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, and, when he comes to know in what company he hath

               <p>That I give the precedency to thoſe of riper years, though ſuch Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms as thoſe are little known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, is becauſe there is no doubt Baptiſm began with them, and could not indeed have found any other entrance into the World; The Baptiſm of Infants, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe, who do moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:36048:160"/>aſſert it, depending upon the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of their Parents, or of thoſe, who are in the place of them. Of whom, if ſome had not been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd in their riper years, thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, that claimed by them, could not with reaſon have pretended to it. Of thoſe of riper years therefore I mean firſt to entreat, and ſhew to <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>what kind</hi> of perſons among them the Sacrament of Baptiſm ought to be adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>Now as it is clear from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's injunction<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> of <hi>diſcipling,</hi> and <hi>baptizing</hi> all Nations, that none of what condition ſoever are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it, who are qualified, as Chriſtianity requires, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it; So the only thing therefore farther neceſſary to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into on this Head, is how men ought to be <hi>qualified</hi> for it, or (as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> expreſſeth it) what is <hi>required</hi> of them. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thoſe <hi>praerequiſites</hi> of Baptiſm, he who enjoyns the <hi>diſcipling,</hi> and baptizing all Nations, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be ſuppos'd to enjoyn the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring of it to all ſuch, in whom thoſe <hi>praerequiſites</hi> are.</p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:36048:161"/>
               <p> Now there are two things again, as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> inſtructs us, which are requir'd of all thoſe, that are to be baptized; <hi>Repentance,</hi> whereby they forſake ſin, and <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby they ſtedfaſtly believe the promiſes made to them in that Sacrament. And for theſe two things at leaſt it hath the aſtipulation of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and I may add alſo of that <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> which is made by the baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Baptiſm, and which having before eſtabliſh'd, I may now the more ſecurely argue from. Witneſs, for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s<note n="†" place="margin">Acts 2.38.</note> enjoyning thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> (who demanded of him, and the reſt, what they ought to do in order to their ſalvation) to <hi>repent, and</hi> ſo <hi>be baptiz'd in the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> And <hi>Philip</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying upon the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who ask'd <hi>what did hinder him to be baptiz'd,</hi> that <hi>if he believ'd</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 8.37.</note> 
                  <hi>with all his heart, he might:</hi> Thereby more than inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that, if he did not, he could not be baptiz'd at all, though all other things concurred to the receiving of it. And indeed, what leſs can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be requir'd of ſuch perſons, when (as was before<note n="†" place="margin">Expl. of Bapt. Part 8.</note> obſerv'd) the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:36048:161"/>baptized perſon makes Profeſſion in his Baptiſm of <hi>renouncing</hi> all ſin, and wickedneſs, and of a <hi>belief</hi> in that Jeſus, into whoſe Religion he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? That Profeſſion of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Repentance, and Faith to have been before in him, as without which otherwiſe he could not there make a ſincere Profeſſion of renouncing ſin, or of believing in the name of the Lord Jeſus. But ſo (that I may add that by the way) the Antient Church appears to have requir'd, before ſhe admitted men to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Baptiſm; <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> where he profeſſeth to give a ſincere account of her doings in this affair, telling thoſe he wrote his <hi>Apology</hi> to, that <hi>ſuch as were perſuaded, and believ'd that the things taught and ſaid by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were true</hi>

               <p>For the clearing of the <hi>firſt</hi> of which we are to know, that though <hi>Repentance,</hi> in ſtrict ſpeech, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than <hi>a ſorrow of mind for thoſe ſins we ſtand guilty of before God;</hi> Yet as even ſo it preſuppoſeth a right apprehenſion of thoſe ſins, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we could never be brought to a due ſorrow for them, ſo taking Repentance (as our <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and the Scripture alſo ſometime doth) as one of the two prerequiſites of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (For S. <hi>Paul</hi> in one place<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 20.21.</note> makes that Repentance, and Faith the <hi>ſum</hi> of his Preaching to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> and in another<note n="(c)" place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> the <hi>foundation</hi> of our Chriſtianity) it will be found to imply in it whatſoever that ſorrow for ſin doth naturally diſpoſe men to, as well as that ſorrow it ſelf: The ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere profeſſing that he <hi>ſhewed both to the Jews, and Gentiles, that they ſhould turn unto God,</hi> as well as <hi>Repent;</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:36048:162"/>and <hi>do works meet for Repentance,</hi> as well as either. To attain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a due underſtanding of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as well as to clear that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of it, which our Catechiſm hath given us, it will be neceſſary for us to enquire what this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doth <hi>preſuppoſe,</hi> what it <hi>imports,</hi> and to what it doth <hi>diſpoſe us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That, which Repentance doth moſt manifeſtly preſuppoſe, is a right apprehenſion of that <hi>ſin,</hi> about which it is to be converſant; And may be fetch'd in part from the dictates of our own reaſon, but more eſpecially from the declarations of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerning it. Such as are, that ſin is the tranſgreſſion of a Law, and particularly of that of God, and that, as ſuch, it juſtly expoſeth us to his wrath, and indignation: Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it is a violation of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to whom we are naturally ſubject, and partly as an equal affront to his goodneſs, who gives us our being, and all things elſe, and who therefore ought more diligently to have been attended to. In fine, that it hath for its wages Death both temporal, and eternal, and under
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:36048:163"/>each of which, without the mercy of God in Chriſt, the ſinner muſt neceſſarily fall. For as theſe are known in part, from the dictates of our own reaſon to be the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that ſin, whereof we ſpeak; So they are much more known to be ſo from the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and conſequently to be known by us toward a right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that, which ought to be the matter of our ſorrow.</p>
               <p>But from hence it will be eaſie to collect, what that ſorrow for ſin doth <hi>import,</hi> which is requir'd of all thoſe, that take upon them the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Even that it importeth ſuch a ſorrow of mind, as hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the violation of God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Goodneſs by it, as well as to the evils which are like to ariſe to it from our ſelves; Our ſorrow being in reaſon to be ſuited to that, which is moſt conſiderable in the object of it. And indeed, as otherwiſe it will be rather a ſorrow for puniſhment, than ſin, becauſe ſin, as ſuch, is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of God's Law, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our ſorrow for it to have a more eſpecial regard to the affront,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:36048:163"/>that is offer'd him thereby; So it will much leſs deſerve thoſe titles, which are given it by the Scripture of being a ſorrow, or <hi>repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Acts 20.21.</note> 
                  <hi>God</hi> (for ſo it is ſometime ſtil'd) and a <hi>ſorrow</hi>

                  <hi>according to God,</hi> or a <hi>Godly</hi> one, as it alſo is: That being neither <hi>toward God,</hi> nor <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God,</hi> which hath not a regard to that affront, which is offer'd to him by ſin, as well as to the evils, which are like to accrue unto our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But becauſe even ſuch a ſorrow will not qualifie us for Baptiſm, unleſs we add thereto what the ſame ſorrow doth <hi>naturally diſpoſe</hi> us to; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make out more fully the true nature of Repentance, as well as to clear our Churches definition of it, I will proceed to that, and ſhew what thoſe things are. Of which nature I reckon firſt an ingenuous <hi>confeſſion of ſin,</hi> and earneſt <hi>prayer</hi> to God for the pardon of it; Sorrow for ſin, when conſidered only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to its appendant puniſhment, being likely enough to diſpoſe us ſo to confeſs, and ask pardon of it, if it were only to unburthen our ſelves, and free our ſelves by that, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:36048:164"/>from the puniſhment we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. How much more then, when conſider'd as a ſorrow for that affront, which we have by means of our ſin offer'd to God's both Authority, and Goodneſs? He, to whom ſuch an affront is matter of ſorrow, being likely enough to be thereby diſpos'd ſo far to acknowledge that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and goodneſs, as to own them upon the poſtfact by confeſſion, and prayer for pardon: He who <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,</hi> and <hi>asketh pardon</hi> of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that God had, and hath an Authority to command, and puniſh him, as he, who doth the <hi>latter,</hi> that God is of equal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as of whom otherwiſe it would be in vain for him to ask pardon for his offences. Whence it was, that when the Church proceeded by ſtrict, and ſafe meaſures, ſhe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught thoſe, that offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Baptiſm, <hi>to ask of God with faſting the forgiveneſs</hi> of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt offences, but (as we learn from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:36048:164"/>nature ſecondly, a <hi>reſolution to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſin,</hi> and purſue the contrary vertues. Which I do not only upon the Authority of the foremention'd <hi>Father,</hi> who reckons that<note n="(g)" place="margin">Loco prius citato.</note> 
                  <hi>alſo</hi> as a prerequiſite to Baptiſm, but as it is a thing, to which ſorrow for ſin, doth alike naturally diſpoſe us; He, to whom ſin is ſo irkſome, needing no other motive, than that irkſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to oblige him to forſake it, and pay a more perfect ſubmiſſion to that Authority, and goodneſs of God, which he hath before ſo ſhamefully violated. I reckon thirdly, as a thing, to which ſorrow for ſin doth equally diſpoſe us, a <hi>preſent forſaking</hi> of thoſe ſins, which we are under a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to commit, as well as a reſolution to do ſo for the time to come; There being the ſame force in a due ſorrow for ſin to diſpoſe men to that, as there is to a reſolution of afterward forſaking it.

And though it do not appear, that the Apoſtles themſelves took this courſe, they baptizing men immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the bare profeſſion of their Repentance, and a reſolution after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to bring forth fruits meet for it: Yet as the reaſon of that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might be, either becauſe of that exuberance of Grace, which was then beſtow'd upon their new Converts or becauſe, by means of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory life, they could not well deferr the Baptiſm of thoſe, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd themſelves, till they had made ſome conſiderable trial of them (which will exempt ſuch Churches from their example, where there is no ſuch exuberance of Grace, and where moreover they have ſetled Paſtors to intend the affairs of them) So we cannot think the Apoſtles would have ever given Baptiſm to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:36048:165"/>ſuch perſons, as ſhould before that Baptiſm of theirs have fallen into thoſe ſins, which they erewhile made profeſſion of abandoning: Sorrow for ſin, where it is hearty, and real, no doubt diſpoſing men as well to a preſent forſaking of it, as it doth to a reſolution concerning it. Which will make the <hi>Repentance</hi> pre-requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Baptiſm to be (as our <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> expreſſeth it) a <hi>Repentance,</hi> whereby as occaſion offers, <hi>we</hi> actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>forſake ſin,</hi> as well as reſolve for the future to abandon it.</p>
               <p>An account being thus given of the <hi>firſt</hi> thing pre-requir'd to Baptiſm, and our Churches definition of it both explain'd, and eſtabliſhed; Paſs we on to that, which is alike pre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to it, even that <hi>Faith,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſtedfaſtly believe the promiſes made to us in that Sacrament.

                     <item>IV. What evidence there is of that being the Faith, or belief, which is pre-requir'd by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to the receiving of that Sacrament.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Now though that <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> which I have choſen to explain, give no other account of thoſe Promiſes, than that they are ſuch as are made to us in that Sacrament; Yet is it not difficult to collect from thence, and from what is before ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Parts</hi> of a Sacrament, that the Catechiſm means no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, than thoſe which make a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of its <hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Graces.</hi> For a Sacrament being before divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into an outward, and viſible ſign, and an inward, and ſpiritual Grace as the only proper parts of it; And the outward, and viſible ſign being in like manner repreſented in it as no farther of value, than as condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to poſſeſs us of the other: No other promiſes can be ſuppos'd to be intended here, than ſuch as make a tender of thoſe inward, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Graces, as which indeed are the only things conſiderable in it. Which
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:36048:166"/>will conſequently make the promiſes here intended to be thoſe, which make a tender for the preſent of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of ſins, and ſanctification, and in the end of everlaſting life.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Thoſe therefore being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which are to be the object of the <hi>Catechumens</hi> Faith, and which accordingly he is ſtedfaſtly to believe; It will not be difficult to ſhew, what that belief of them pre-ſuppoſeth, which is the ſecond thing to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into. For that belief of them muſt at leaſt pre-ſuppoſe a belief of all that, which is neceſſary to bring us to the belief of the other. More particularly it pre-ſuppoſeth, <hi>as to our ſelves,</hi> that we believe our ſelves to be naturally under a ſtate of ſin, and death, as without which there could be no place for that ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and remiſſion, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in Baptiſm; And that we are yet farther off from any title to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, as which if we had, there would have been no need of a Promiſe in Baptiſm of it. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth again <hi>as to Chriſt,</hi> in whom all the promiſes of God are Yea, and <hi>Amen,</hi> a like ſtedfaſt belief that there
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:36048:167"/>was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt, and that he was appointed by God to convey ſuch graces to us; That, agreeably to the predictions of the Scripture, and the will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, he took upon him our nature, and ſuffer'd in it to purchaſe thoſe Graces, and that he ever ſince intends the exhibiting of what he hath ſo purchas'd; The belief of theſe, and the like Articles of our Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as manifeſtly preſuppos'd to the belief of thoſe Promiſes, which in this place we are required to intend.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That which will it may be more concern us to enquire, is what our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> means by a <hi>ſtedfaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of them. For my more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly reſolution whereof I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire firſt what it means by <hi>belief,</hi> and then by a <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> one.</p>
               <p>Now by belief may be meant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>ſimple aſſent of the mind,</hi> and in which ſenſe there is no doubt it is oftentimes taken in Chriſtian Writers; Or there may be meant alſo a belief with affiance, and ſuch as beſide the aſſent of the mind, or underſtanding to them, doth alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a truſt in them, or in God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:36048:167"/>of them. By vertue of which (as I have elſewhere diſcours'd<note n="(k)" place="margin">Expl. of the Decal. Com. 1. Part 3.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the grace of truſt) the heart, or will is prompted to deſire, as well as aſſent to the matter of the divine promiſes, and acquieſce in thoſe for the obtaining of it. And indeed if we may judge any thing by our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> (to which the Articles<note n="(l)" place="margin">Art. 11.</note> of our Church do alſo particularly referr us in the point of juſtifying Faith) this latter belief muſt be here intended; Becauſe a belief, which hath for its end the remiſſion of ſins in Baptiſm, and conſequently a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying one. For <hi>the right, and true Chriſtian</hi> Faith (ſaith one of our<note n="(m)" place="margin">Homily of Salvation. Part 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Homilies</hi>) <hi>is not only to believe that the Holy Scripture, and all the</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited <hi>Articles of our Faith, are true, but alſo to have a ſure truſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God's merciful promiſes to be ſaved from everlaſting damnation by Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>it is not only,</hi> ſaith another<note n="(n)" place="margin">Hom. of Faith.</note>, <hi>the common belief of the Articles of our Faith, but it is alſo a ſure truſt, and conſidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a ſtedfaſt hope of all good things to be receiv'd at God's hands.</hi> In
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:36048:168"/>fine, ſaith the ſame<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> Homily, <hi>the very ſure, lively Chriſtian faith is not only to believe all things of God, which are contained in holy Scripture, but alſo to have an earneſt truſt, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſuppos'd (as we may, becauſe we can have no more <hi>Authentick</hi> interpretation of it) to be the ſenſe of the <hi>belief</hi> here intended, it will not be difficult to ſhew, what our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> means by a <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> one.</p>
               <p>For conſidering the belief of theſe Promiſes as an Aſſent of the mind to them, ſo a ſtedfaſt belief will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that, which is free from all doubts, and which the mind of man gives to thoſe Promiſes without any the leaſt fear of their being any Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion in them; Which the mind of man may well give, conſidering whoſe thoſe Promiſes are, and that they have both God, and Chriſt for the Authors of them. On the other ſide, if we conſider the belief intended as <hi>including</hi> in it alſo an <hi>affiance,</hi> or <hi>truſt,</hi> and by vertue of which the <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> is prompted to deſire, as well as believe the matter of thoſe Promiſes, and acquieſce in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:36048:168"/>for the attaining of it; So this <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> belief will alſo imply ſuch a one, as is firmly rooted in the <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> and can no more be rooted out of it by the force of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than the other by doubts, or ſcruples. And indeed, as I do not ſee how any other belief, than that, can anſwer ſuch glorious promiſes as are made to us in the Sacrament of Baptiſm; ſo I ſee as little reaſon to doubt,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. What evidence there is of <hi>that</hi> being the Faith, or belief, which is pre-requir'd by Chriſtianity to the receiving of it. For though S. <hi>Luke</hi> may ſeem to intimate by the account he gives of the Baptiſm of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Acts 8.12.</note>, that they were baptiz'd upon a ſimple belief of what <hi>Philip preach'd concerning the things of the Kingdom of God;</hi> Yet he doth much more clearly intimate afterward, that Chriſtianity requir'd another ſort of belief, and ſuch as was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd with an adherence of the <hi>will</hi> unto them: He making it the condition of the Eunuch's Baptiſm afterward, that he ſhould believe <hi>with
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:36048:169"/>all his heart</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Acts 8.37.</note>; Which is an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that in the language of the Scripture referrs rather to the <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> than to the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but however cannot well be thought not to include them there, where the believing with <hi>all</hi> the heart is requir'd. And indeed, as I do not ſee, conſidering the Doctrine of our <hi>Firſt Reformers,</hi> why this noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould be ſo exploded, as it ſeems to me lately to have been; As I do much leſs ſee why men ſhould ſo boyle at that <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which was wont to be attributed in an eſpecial manner to it: So, if I live to finiſh the work I am now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I will in a <hi>Comment</hi> upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> (which I have almoſt gather'd ſufficient ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for) endeavour to clear both the one, and the other, that men may neither take occaſion from thence to diſcard good works as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, nor yet ſtay themſelves upon any other, than the promiſes of Chriſt, and on which the holieſt men upon earth, when they have been approaching near God's tribunal, have found themſelves oblig'd to caſt
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:36048:169"/>themſelves. In the mean time a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to repreſs the youthful heats of thoſe, who can hardly forbear ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at ſuch <hi>antiquated</hi> notions, I will ſet before them the <hi>advice,</hi> which was order'd to be given to ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when good works to be ſure were not without their juſt repute. It is among the Interrogatories, which are ſaid<note n="(r)" place="margin">Field of the Church, Append. to the 3d. Book pa. 303.</note> to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by <hi>Anſelme</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and particularly after that, which prompts the Prieſt to ask, <hi>Doſt thou believe, that thou canſt not be ſav'd, but by the death of Chriſt,</hi> and the ſick perſons Anſwer, that <hi>he did ſo. Go too therefore</hi> (as the Prieſt was taught to proceed) <hi>and whilſt thy ſoul remaineth in thee, place thy confidence in this death alone, and in no other thing, commit thy ſelf wholly to it, cover thy ſelf wholly with it, immerſe, fix, and wrap thy ſelf wholly in it. And if the Lord God will judge thee, ſay, I put the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt between me, and thy judgment, otherwiſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not with thee. And if he ſay that thou art a ſinner, ſay, Lord I put the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:36048:170"/>between me, and my ſins. If he ſay to thee thou haſt deſerv'd damnation, ſay, Lord, I put the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt between me, and my evil deſerts, and I offer the ſame death for that merit, which I ought to have had, and have not. If he continue as yet to ſay, that he is angry with thee, ſay, Lord, I oppoſe the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt between me, and thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</hi> Words, which ſhew what kind of <hi>Faith</hi> was ſometime thought to be a <hi>juſtfying</hi> one, and what ſtreſs was laid upon it, before ever <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,</hi> or any thing of that nature was heard of in the World.</p>

                  </note> commanding his Diſciples to <hi>ſuffer lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children to come unto him,</hi> and <hi>bleſſing thoſe,</hi> that came; So I am yet more confirmed in it by the unprofitable pains <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> took to take off the force of that Text, or rather the pitiful eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he made uſe of in order to it. For had not the Church laid great ſtreſs upon that paſſage of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, why did not he, as the World hath ſince learn'd to do, wholly omit the mention of it, as a Text no way pertinent to the buſineſs of Infant-Baptiſm? Or, if he thought good to take notice of it, why did he not turn the force of it another
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:36048:172"/>way, and ſay, as others have, that nothing more was intended by it, than to let men know they muſt put on the property of little Children, if they meant to enter into Chriſt's Kingdom? For either of theſe certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had been more proper, than what we find him to alledge <hi>in theſe words,</hi> as to the <hi>delaying</hi> of the Baptiſm of Infants. <hi>The Lord indeed ſaith, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid not Children to come unto me. Let them come therefore, when they are grown, let them come when they may learn, and when they may be taught whither they are to come. Let them be made Chriſtians, when they may be able to know Chriſt.</hi> For what is this to the purpoſe of our Saviour, who check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Diſciples for hindering <hi>thoſe</hi> from coming to him, who were brought to him before they were in a <hi>condition</hi> to learn, who in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were brought to him in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents arms, and were both taken by him into his own, and bleſſed by him even then? For if the Diſciples were check'd for going about to hinder ſuch Children, his meaning was that they ſhould ſuffer <hi>ſuch</hi> to come unto him, and not keep them back from
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:36048:172"/>coming, till they <hi>ceaſed</hi> to be <hi>ſuch.</hi> But of ſuch force it ſeems was that Text then thought, that ſome reply how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever muſt be made to it; Or the deference men had for the Church, that urged it, would have ſpoil'd his device of delaying the Baptiſm of them, till they came of years. Which will make it ſo much the more reaſonable to enquire, what there is in the Text it ſelf, which might juſtifie the confidence of the one, or give occaſion to the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent anſwer of the other.</p>
               <p>For the better diſcovery whereof we are to know, that when certain perſons not named, but it ſeems who look'd upon our Saviour as a man of God, brought their Children to Chriſt, that he might <hi>touch</hi> them, that is to ſay, as our Saviour expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their meaning, that he might <hi>lay his hands upon them, and bleſs them;</hi> His Diſciples, whether as looking upon it as no way beſeeming their Maſter to concern himſelf about Children,<note n="*" place="margin">Aret. in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.

And I cannot therefore but think, that the true reaſon of our Saviour's making uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>ſuch,</hi> inſtead of <gap reason="foreign">

As he afterward<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mark 10.15.</note> more expreſly ſignifies, when he tells them, that <hi>whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, he ſhall not enter therein.</hi> Which ſuppos'd a way is opened for the inferring of that Baptiſm of Infants, which, this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage both now, and of old was made uſe of to evince. For it appearing from the premiſes, that Infants have a right to the Kingdom of Heaven, and upon, and by vertue of that right to be brought to Chriſt alſo; They muſt conſequently have a right alſo to thoſe <hi>means,</hi> which are by the ſame Chriſt appointed to put them into the poſſeſſion of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Which Baptiſm certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo, that, ordinarily at leaſt, none can enter into that Kingdom without<note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> being <hi>born again</hi> by it, it cannot without injuſtice be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from thoſe Children, to whom
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:36048:174"/>the other doth appertain. Neither will it avail to ſay, though the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection be not to be deſpis'd, that by this rule our Saviour ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf have baptiz'd, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Diſciples to baptize thoſe Children, that were now brought unto him for his bleſſing. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that one Argument will not ſolve another, and much leſs hinder the matter thereof from being true, or concluſive; There might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough, though the premiſes be allow'd, for our Saviour's not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, or requiring his Diſciples to baptize thoſe Children, who were now brought unto him for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: Partly upon the account of the incompetency of thoſe, that brought them, and who being not Diſciples themſelves, but as is probable, of the <hi>multitude</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Mark 10.1. Matt. 19.2.</note> that followed him, could not claim from our Saviour, nor he ſo regularly beſtow Baptiſm upon their Children; And partly to let the World ſee, that he was not ti'd to any methods himſelf in the diſpenſing of the graces of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For that our Saviour, by that bleſſing which he gave them, gave
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:36048:175"/>thoſe Children <hi>rem Sacramenti,</hi> or the Graces of Baptiſm, and ſo ſhew'd yet more the title Children have to it, cannot well be doubted of by any, who ſhall conſider how zealous he was for their being brought to him, as that too upon the account of the title they had to the Kingdom of Heaven. For conſidering that zeal of his, and the ground of it, what can be more reaſonable than to think, that our Saviour agreeably thereto did by his bleſſing conferr upon them that Evangelical regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which was to fit them for the Kingdom of Heaven, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which conſidering the impurity of their nature, and the neceſſity of being thus born anew, they could not regularly obtain it. And I have been the more particular in deducing, and preſſing the preſent argument; Partly becauſe led thereto by the meer force of the Text it ſelf, and the Authority of the Church that imployed it, till by accident I fell upon thoſe things I have before quoted out of <hi>Aretius;</hi> And partly becauſe I think it a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervice to the Church of God to ſtrengthen one old Argument, than
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:36048:175"/>deviſe many new ones: Such a courſe procuring the more reſpect to the Church's both opinion, and practice, as ſhewing it to proceed upon ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Arguments, and ſuch as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not lightly to be refus'd.</p>
               <p>My <hi>ſecond</hi> Argument for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants ſhall be taken from that <hi>holineſs,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.14.</note> attributes to the <hi>Children of Chriſtian Parents</hi> (yea where only one of them is ſuch) upon the account of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from them. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> having before perſuaded the <hi>believing party</hi> to continue with the <hi>unbelieving one,</hi> ſuppoſing that <hi>unbelieving</hi> one to be as willing to continue with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, as a <hi>motive</hi> to the doing of it alledgeth, that the <hi>unbelieving</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>is ſanctified by the believing,</hi> and proves that <hi>ſanctification</hi> again by the <hi>holineſs of the Children,</hi> that come from them, as which otherwiſe thoſe Children could not have in them, but the <hi>contrary.</hi> Now I demand what that <hi>holineſs</hi> is, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth to be the property of thoſe, who come from ſuch a ſanctified couple, that is to ſay, whether an <hi>inward holineſs,</hi> or an <hi>outward</hi> one?
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:36048:176"/>If they, who would avoid the force of this Text as to the Baptiſm of Infants, ſay an <hi>inward</hi> holineſs, they ſay more than we deſire, or can with truth be affirmed, becauſe though <hi>Original Sin</hi> be traduc'd from the Parents, yet inward holineſs is not, as being the product of the Spirit of God, and his inſtrument Baptiſm. But if they do however attribute ſuch a holineſs to thoſe Children, they ſay enough to evince, that Baptiſm ought not to be deny'd to them. For <hi>who</hi> (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake<note n="(e)" place="margin">Acts 10.47.</note> upon another occaſion) <hi>can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi> the <hi>water</hi> of Baptiſm <hi>to thoſe, who have receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as to be ſure all, that are internally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have? It remains therefore, that if the Children of ſuch matches be not <hi>internally</hi> holy, they are <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> ſo, and that external holineſs therefore, if it may be, to be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated by us. Now I demand Firſt, what external holineſs can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd in thoſe Children, but ſuch by which they come to belong to God in a more peculiar manner, than the Children of other matches do? This being the nature of all things, that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:36048:176"/>are externally holy, whether by the voluntary conſecration of men, or the Inſtitution, or choice of God. I demand ſecondly, ſuppoſing thoſe Children to belong more to God, than the Children of other matches, whether by their thus becoming the peculiar property of God, they may not be ſuppos'd to be more dear to him, than the Children of other matches are? Every one naturally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an affection to ſuch, as belong to him, ſuitably to that nearneſs, wherein they belong to him. I demand Thirdly, ſuppoſing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch matches to be more dear to God than the Children of others, whether we are not to think he will take a more particular care of them, than of others? The care of any perſon being always ſuitable to the affection he bears to thoſe, who are the object of his care. I demand Fourthly, whether, ſuppoſing ſuch a particular care of the Children of ſuch matches, he will not take a more particular care of them as to their eternal welfare, than he doth of the Children of other men; All other care, without this, being of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:36048:177"/>little value to the party cared for, and, beſide that (as experience ſhews) equally extended by God to the Children of other matches, as well as to the deſcendants of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. I demand Fifthly, ſuppoſing ſuch a particular care as to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal welfare, whether he will not alſo allow them more means to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the compaſſing of it, than he can be ſuppos'd to allow to the Children of other Parents? All care, where it is reaſonable, and juſt, employing ſutable means to bring that care of its unto effect. Now what peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar means doth, or can God allow to the Children of Chriſtian Parents, as to the procuring of their eternal welfare, ſuppoſing them to die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come of years, as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them do, unleſs it be the Sacrament of Baptiſm? For as theſe, no more than other Children, are capable of the benefits of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by the graces of Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; So they have no other way therefore, ſave the Sacrament of Baptiſm, either to be deliver'd from the guilt of Original Sin, or enſtated in Chriſts heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:36048:177"/>I conclude therefore, that the Children of Chriſtian Parents, or of either of them being holy, they do by that holineſs of theirs acquire a right to a greater holineſs, I mean the holineſs of Baptiſm.

Which as it is the holineſs, that I
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:36048:178"/>have been all along enforcing, and endeavouring to evince from thence Children's right unto another; So of what force it is toward the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it, will need no other light, than that, which we have from <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi> For with what force can any man deny them the <hi>holineſs</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, who are <hi>deſign'd,</hi> or mark'd out <hi>for it by the prerogative of their birth,</hi> and (as it may happen, and often doth) can no other way attain that <hi>holineſs,</hi> or that <hi>ſalvation,</hi> which is conſequent upon it? But becauſe ſome men have advanc'd <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> and a more <hi>improper holineſs,</hi> even that by which Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the iſſue of a lawful marriage, and not of an <hi>unlawful mixture;</hi> And becauſe too they have in part advanc'd that holineſs upon the difficulty of comprehending, how the unbeliever can otherwiſe be ſanctified by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, than by making the match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them two to be lawful; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will both ſet my ſelf to ſhew, that the unbeliever may be otherwiſe ſanctified by the believer, than by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him, or her to be a lawful match to the believer, and that the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:36048:178"/>which S. <hi>Paul</hi> attributes to the Children of ſuch a match, cannot be underſtood of ſuch a holineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become a lawful, or legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Iſſue. And I alledge for the former of theſe the unbelieving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's, for inſtance, being ſo ſanctified by the believing Wife, as not only to become a <hi>lawful</hi> Husband to her, but a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> one, and ſo, as to entitle the Iſſue of them both to the common priviledges of Chriſtianity. Which is brought about by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Husband's becoming <hi>one fleſh,</hi> not any longer with an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Wife, but with a believing, and Chriſtian one, and from whom that ſanctification is derived to him. Even as the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms<note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.16.</note> 
                  <hi>him,</hi> that <hi>converſeth with an Harlot,</hi> to become <hi>one fleſh with that Harlot,</hi> with whom he doth ſo converſe, and ſo receive pollution from her. Neither will it avail to ſay (as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it may be) that the <hi>believing Wife</hi> is as much <hi>one fleſh</hi> with the <hi>unbelieving Husband,</hi> as the <hi>unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husband</hi> is <hi>with her,</hi> and may therefore be as unclean by him, as he can be ſuppos'd to be ſanctified by
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:36048:179"/>her. For neither firſt is the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wife <hi>as much</hi> one fleſh with the unbelieving Husband, as the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Husband is with her, unleſs it be as to the uſe of, or power over one another's Bodies: Partly, becauſe, where there is ſo great an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the match, the denomination is in reaſon to be taken from the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter party, which to be ſure the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is; And partly, becauſe that conſent of mind from which this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion proceeds, and by which it is to be upheld, is more entire, and full upon the part of the unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, than it is upon the part of the believing Wife.

                  <hi>well pleaſed</hi> to live with her notwithſtanding, conſents in ſome meaſure to dwell with her as a Chriſtian, and gives no contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:36048:179"/>indication of a farther conſent with her in that <hi>Religion:</hi> There being otherwiſe no great likelihood of his continuing his <hi>Complacency,</hi> as well as cohabitation to her, who had abandon'd him as to <hi>his.</hi> But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the believing Wife is not ſo much <hi>one</hi> with the unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as he is with her, and cannot therefore be ſo likely to be polluted by him, as he is to be ſanctified by her; So ſhe becomes yet leſs likely to be polluted by him, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with him in ſuch <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Acts,</hi> as are not only lawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but moreover the indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duties of that marriage, which ſhe had contracted, and which, whilſt he is thus pleas'd to dwell with her, ſhe is by our Apoſtle himſelf obliged to maintain. And indeed as from ſuch a match there is more reaſon to expect ſanctification to the unbeliever, than there is of any fear of pollution to the other; So there will be yet leſs doubt of it, if we conſider the <hi>ſanctification</hi> here ſpoken of, not as an <hi>inward,</hi> but an <hi>outward</hi> one, and ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one too, by which the party
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:36048:180"/>ſanctified attains only the priviledge of being accounted of as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Husband, and accordingly of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Children, that deſcend from them both a right to the Sacrament of Baptiſm. For what leſs can be expected from a merciful God, where the unbeliever, though continuing ſuch, yet takes pleaſure notwithſtanding that in his Chriſtian Conſort? And ſhe, on the other ſide, though abominating his Infidelity, yet in compliance with that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, wherein Chriſtianity found her, cohabits with him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and no doubt both doth, and will employ all her kindneſs, and endeavours to gain him to a farther approbation both of her, and of the Religion ſhe hath eſpous'd? Which ſuppos'd, a way will be open to give a clearer account of the thing intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and withal of the force it is of to perſuade the believing Wifes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing with the unbelieving Husband, if he (as is ſuppos'd in the preſent caſe) is as willing to dwell with her: The force thereof lying in this, that the believing Wife ſhould in that caſe be ſo far from being polluted by
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:36048:180"/>the converſe of the unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (which was no doubt theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> fear, when they put this caſe to S. <hi>Paul</hi>) that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the unbelieving Husband ſhould be ſo far ſanctified by her, as to be to her in the place of a Chriſtian one, and enjoy all the priviledges of ſuch; The unbelieving Husband by becoming one fleſh with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Wife becoming ſo far Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian alſo, and ſo accounted of both by God, and the Church. Of which they had this undeniable proof, that the Children of thoſe matches were not look'd upon as <hi>unclean,</hi> or <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> (which they muſt have been in part, if the unbeliever had not been ſomeway <hi>ſanctified,</hi> as well as the believer) but accounted of as ſo far <hi>holy,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as to be admitted to thoſe priviledges, to which the Children of Chriſtian Parents were, and particularly to that Baptiſm, by which a better holineſs is convey'd. This I take to be a fair, and clear account of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s words, and particularly of that <hi>holineſs,</hi> which he attributes to thoſe Children, that deſcend from the forementioned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:36048:181"/>And I am yet more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it by the fondneſs of that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which hath been ſet up to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant it, and by which the Children of ſuch matches become the iſſue of a <hi>lawful marriage,</hi> and not of an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful mixture.</hi> For beſide that they, who advance this notion, make the words <hi>Elſe were your Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> &amp;c. to referr rather to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the believer's cohabiting with the unbeliever, than to the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's being ſanctified by the believer, to which laſt yet it apparently referrs, and is aſſign'd by S. <hi>Paul</hi> as a proof of; They ſuppoſe that in this notion of theirs, which there is not the leaſt ground for, and which indeed this very place doth ſufficiently confute. For who ever ſaid, or could ſay that the marriages of the Heathen were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, which yet they muſt have been, if there needed the cohabitation of the faitful to make them lawful, and the Children that were born of them to be legitimate? Nay who ſeeth not that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth thoſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages to be lawful, when he requires the believing party to cohabit with the unbeliever? For otherwiſe no
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:36048:181"/>doubt he would rather have advis'd to break off all commerce with the Infidel, or proceed to a new contract. Both which yet he is ſo far from, that he ſeems to me not very willing to allow of a perfect breach, even when the unbeliever doth depart from the believer. For though he faith<note n="(l)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.15.</note> that <hi>a brother, or ſiſter is not in bondage in ſuch a caſe,</hi> and may therefore, if they pleaſe, look upon themſelves as loos'd from the unbeliever; Yet he tells them<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> withall that <hi>God hath called us to peace,</hi> and therefore, (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him) that breaches of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would be avoided as much as might be; And he tells them too<note n="(n)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.16.</note>, that if they would not be over forward to make uſe of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which the unbeliever gave them by <hi>deſerting</hi> them, there might be hopes of the <hi>unbelieving Wife,</hi> or <hi>Husband</hi> being wrought upon by the <hi>believer's</hi> patience, and forbearance, and reconcil'd both to them, and their Religion. However as there is no pretence from this place of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's making the marriage between the unbeliever and themſelves to be
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:36048:182"/>a lawful one, as which was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Nor therefore for making the <hi>holineſs</hi> of their Children to be no other than a <hi>civil</hi> one, and by which they only became a legitimate iſſue; So there is the more reaſon ſtill to underſtand the <hi>holineſs</hi> of that match, and the iſſues of it, as one that enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles them to the <hi>outward priviledges</hi> of Chriſtianity, and by which the unbelieving whether Husband, or Wife comes to be accounted of as a Chriſtian one, and the Children of both parties as having a right to that Sacrament, by which all are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiated into Chriſtianity, and partake of its Regeneration and Remiſſion.</p>
               <p>My third and laſt argument for the baptizing of the Infants, or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtian Parents ſhall be taken from the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of thoſe Infants, or Children, which deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and after which I do not ſee what doubt can be well made of the other: Partly, upon the account of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy there is between <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and partly upon account of the Children of Chriſtian Parents having as good a right to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:36048:186"/>being derived to the Church from the Apoſtles, either the Catholicks would have ſo confidently alledged it againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> or the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſo eaſily, and without any the leaſt oppoſition have admitted it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Now as if we allow Infants to be capable of Baptiſm, we muſt conſequently allow them the <hi>graces</hi> of that Sacrament, becauſe Baptiſm was intended to convey them; So I muſt needs ſay, I do not ſee why (ſuppoſing <hi>Original ſin,</hi> which hath been before ſufficiently eſtabliſh'd) we ſhould ſcruple to attribute to them the graces of that <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and particularly <hi>remiſſion,</hi> and <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> For if Infants are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the <hi>guilt</hi> of Original ſin, there is ſo far forth place for, and a neceſſity of <hi>remiſſion;</hi> And if the ſame Infants are naturally under the pollution of it, or (as our <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> expreſſeth it) are <hi>by nature born in ſin, and the children of wrath,</hi> they are alike capable by Baptiſm of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regenerated, or made the <hi>children of grace.</hi> Not that there is, or can be even in baptiz'd Infants any <hi>actual
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:36048:187"/>perception of,</hi> or <hi>adheſion to</hi> that, which is <hi>ſpiritually good,</hi> but a <hi>diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to both, and by vertue whereof the ſoul is fitted, and inclin'd to each, when years, and opportunity invite: As the ſame ſoul is to <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> when it arrives at years of maturity, by vertue of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties, that are from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in it. Which is a ſort of regeneration, that is moſt ſutable to the ſtate of Infancy, and beyond which therefore, whilſt they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that ſtate, we are not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to expect; But is withal as true a regeneration as that, which is wrought in thoſe of riper years, and by which the ſouls of the parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated actually perceive, and cleave to that good, which the other is only diſpoſed to: That actual perception, and <hi>adheſion</hi> being not ſo much any part of their regeneration, or new birth, as the effects, or iſſues of it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But becauſe how clear ſoever Infant Baptiſm may thus far ſeem, yet it cannot be deny'd to be encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with many, and great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

               <p>That, which is moſt to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd of the former ſort, is that<note n="(a)" place="margin">See <hi>Jer. Tayl</hi> Liberty of <hi>Proph.

Which it endeavours <hi>in part</hi> from <hi>Circumciſions</hi> being but a <hi>Type,</hi> or figure of Baptiſm, and ſo either proving nothing at all without ſome expreſs to ſignifie ſuch a thing to be its purpoſe, or after the nature of ſuch things, directing us rather to a ſpiritual childhood in order to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, than ſhewing a natural child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to be a due ſubject of it; And in <hi>part</hi> alſo from Circumciſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in all things a rule to the Chriſtians Baptiſm, and particularly
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:36048:188"/>not in the <hi>perſons,</hi> that are to be baptized (Women as well as Men being confeſſedly the ſubject of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) nor in the time of their receiving of it. For if Circumciſion be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient direction for the baptizing of Infants, why not alſo a like directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the confining of it to the <hi>Males?</hi> And if it were to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection as to the baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, why not alſo as to the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of them upon the eighth day (which was the day of adminiſtring Circumciſion) as that <hi>Fidus,</hi> whom S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> anſwer'd, ſeemed to be perſuaded, and accordingly argued it from the like adminiſtration of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
               <p>As to what is objected concerning Circumciſions being but a type of Baptiſm, and ſo either proving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all without ſome expreſs to ſignifie ſuch to be its purpoſe, which is not pretended in the preſent caſe, or if proving any thing as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of childhood, yet directing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a ſpiritual, than a natural one; I anſwer that as I ſee not why Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſhould be look'd upon as only a type of Baptiſm, nor indeed
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:36048:188"/>as any type at all, unleſs it be in a general ſenſe, and as a thing that is like unto another may be look'd upon as a type of that, to which it is ſo, in which ſenſe I my ſelf have alſo us'd the <hi>word,</hi> and allow it ſo to be, ſo we do not at all argue from Circumciſion, as it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a type of Baptiſm, but as a ſign of the ſame righteouſneſs of Faith, of which Baptiſm is, and of the ſame gracious Covenant, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures it. And in this ſenſe as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders us to argue from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſions being beſtowed upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants then, that that which is a ſign of the ſame righteouſneſs of faith under the Goſpel is in reaſon to be extended to the ſame perſons; So there is this in particular to enforce it, that Chriſtian Parents would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe fall ſhort, in the account of God, of the priviledges of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſcendants of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Of which what account can be given, when <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whom they both claim, is declared to be the Father of them both, yea is ſaid by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have receiv'd the ſign of Circumciſion, not only as a <hi>ſeal,</hi> or
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:36048:189"/>aſſurance to himſelf <hi>of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith,</hi> which he before had, but a ſeal, or an aſſurance alſo of his being to the ſame purpoſes a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> of thoſe that believe, though they be not circumciſed, as well as a Father of thoſe that were.</p>
               <p>There is as little reaſon to be ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd by what is alledged in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond inſtance, that if Circumciſion be a ſufficient direction for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants, it may as well be a direction for the confining of it to the Males, and for the confining of it too to the eighth day after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants birth. Becauſe firſt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm hath nothing in it to confine it to the Males, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion had, but on the contrary is equally fitted to be adminiſtred to both Sexes. And ſecondly becauſe it appears from what was before ſaid<note n="(c)" place="margin">Part 1.</note> concerning the <hi>Rite</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the want of Circumciſion was afterwards ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd to the Females by Baptiſm, and they thereby even in their Infancy initiated into the ſame Covenant with the other. For this ſhews yet more, how little reaſon there is
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:36048:189"/>to argue from Circumciſions being confin'd to the Males, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm ought to be ſo; Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how much more reaſon there is to extend it both to Male, and Female, and ſo to all of the ſame Infant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. If therefore there be any thing to hinder our arguing from Circumciſion in this particular, it muſt be its not being pretended by our ſelves to be a direction as to the day of its adminiſtration, as well as to the perſons, to whom it ought to be adminiſtred. But beſide that there is a vaſt difference between the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom any Sacrament is to be given, and the preciſe day, on which it is to be ſo, and therefore not the like reaſon for Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's directing as to this, as there is for its directing as to the other; What Circumciſion directs as to the caſe of Infants is more a favour, than a command, whereas what is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as to the <hi>preciſe day</hi> is rather a command, than a favour. Now it being a rul'd caſe, That Favours are rather to be enlarg'd, than reſtrain'd, eſpecially under a Diſpenſation, which is ſo manifeſtly gracious, as that of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:36048:190"/>the Goſpel is, there may be reaſon enough for our interpreting what is ſaid concerning the Circumciſion of Infants to the equal, or rather grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter benefit of Infants now, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that Sacrament, which came in place of it, to be rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtned, than deferred to a day, to which poſſibly they may not arrive, but however to be given them as ſoon, as a convenient opportunity preſents it ſelf. Add hereunto the difference there is between Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and Baptiſm as to the trouble, or danger, which may attend the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of them to ſuch tender bodies, as thoſe of Infants are. For there being a greater trouble, and danger to Infants from the Rite of Circumciſion, than there is from the Rite of Baptiſm; There might be greater reaſon for the deferring of that to the eighth day, than there is for the deferring of this. And what is therefore, as to that particular, directed concerning Circumciſion, not to be drawn into example in the matter of Baptiſm, though other more material, and more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circumſtances are.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:36048:190"/>
               <p> But leaving what is commonly urg'd againſt the Argument from the Circumciſing of Infants, becauſe, as I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently aſſoil'd by the foregoing diſcourſe. Let us take a view of ſuch Objections as ſtrike more directly at Infant Baptiſm, or at leaſt of the more material ones. Such as I take to be firſt the want of an expreſs command, or direction for the adminiſtring of Baptiſm to Infants; Secondly, their being inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that regeneration, which is the great intent and end of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or giving no ſutable indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it afterwards; Thirdly, their being as incapable of anſwering what is prerequired to it on the part of the perſons to be baptized, or is to be performed by them in the receiving of it.</p>
               <p>That which ſeems to ſtick much with the Adverſaries of Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and is accordingly urg'd at all turns againſt the Friends, or Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, is the want of an expreſs command, or direction for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring of Baptiſm to them. Which objection ſeems to be the more reaſonable, becauſe Baptiſm,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:36048:191"/>as well as other Sacraments, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all its force from Inſtitution, they may ſeem to have no right to, or benefit by it, who appear not by the inſtitution of that Sacrament to be intitled to it, but rather, by the qualifications which it requires, to be excluded from it. And poſſibly more might be of the opinion of the Objecters, if there had not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an expreſs Law for admitting Infants to that righteouſneſs of Faith, of which Baptiſm is a ſign, and a means of conveyance, and for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them too by ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſign, as that of Baptiſm is. But ſuch an expreſs law having been before given by God, and that law as notorious as any law in either Teſtament, there was no reaſon<note n="(d)" place="margin">See Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet's <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum.</hi> Part 1. cap. 1. §. 3.</note> for God to give any ſuch expreſs law for the ſo adminiſtring of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or for us to expect it from him: It being eaſie to collect from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy there is between the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and the great graciouſneſs of the preſent diſpenſation, that what was communicated to the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſterity by the ſign of Circumciſion, which was then the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:36048:191"/>ſtanding way of adminiſtring it, was alike intended for the Children of thoſe, who were to as good, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſe the Children of the ſame <hi>Abraham,</hi> and intended too to be tranſmitted to them by their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sacrament, and to which (as was before obſerv'd) the great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Goſpel were annex'd by our Saviour<note n="(e)" place="margin">Joh. 3 5.</note> himſelf. Which Argumentation is ſo much the more reaſonable, becauſe it appears by what was but now ſuggeſted, that our Saviour, whoſe Inſtitution Baptiſm was, gave a ſufficient indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his own kindneſs to that tender eſtate, yea of his owning thoſe, that were of it, to have a right to that Kingdom of Heaven, to which Baptiſm by his own appointment was intended to admit men.</p>
               <p>The next great Objection againſt the Baptiſm of Infants is their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd incapacity of that regeneration, which is the great end, and intent of Baptiſm, or giving no ſuitable indications of it, when they begin to be in a natural capacity to exert it. The former whereof the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts argue from the Scripture's
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:36048:192"/>ſpeaking of it<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23.</note> as produced by the <hi>word of truth,</hi> and other ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional means; As the latter by the little appearance there is of it in many of thoſe, that are baptiz'd, after they arrive at the years of diſcretion: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially where, as it often happens in the Dominion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> they are taken away from their Parents, before they come to be of any years, and bred up in the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For under this they are ſo far from giving any indications of a Chriſtian <hi>regeneration,</hi> that our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> hath no greater, or more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemies, than they.</p>
               <p>As to what is argu'd toward the proof of Infants incapacity of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from the Scriptures ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it as produc'd by the word of truth, and other ſuch rational ways of procedure, I muſt needs ſay I do not ſee why it ſhould be alledg'd in this particular, unleſs it any where intimated, that there was no other way of producing it, no not in the Souls of Infants. For the Scripture ſpeaking <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>of men</hi> converted from Judaiſm, or Heatheniſm to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and conſequently brought
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:36048:192"/>to it in a rational way; What is ſpoken of their regeneration, is not to be drawn into example here, unleſs the ſame Scripture did any where inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that there was no other way of regeneration than that, or it could not be otherwiſe produced. Which beſide the affront it offers to the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of God's ſpirit, and which even in <hi>men</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to have the chiefeſt ſtroke, will need no other confutation, than Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting man at firſt after his own image without any concurrence of his, and producing in our Saviour, even in his conception, that perfect <hi>holineſs,</hi> which was in him. For why may not God produce in an Infant that imperfect regeneration, whereof we ſpeak, as well as he did that more perfect Righteouſneſs, and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, wherewith our firſt Parents were created, or that more excellent, as well as more durable one, which he did in our Saviour from the very beginning, and which the Scripture it ſelf attributes to the Holy Ghoſt's <hi>overſhadowing</hi> his Mother's Womb? But it may be, though Infants are not incapable of regeneration, and ſo
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:36048:193"/>far forth cannot with reaſon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd the Sacrament of it; Yet there is evidence enough upon the <hi>poſtfact,</hi> that no ſuch thing is collated in their Baptiſm, and that Baptiſm of theirs therefore not to be look'd upon as a legitimate one. For if the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration we ſpeak of were collated in the Baptiſm of Infants, it would, (becauſe all Infants are alike qualifi'd for that Sacrament) be collated in ſome meaſure upon all of them, which yet the future behaviour of many of them doth render juſtly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable: Many of them being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward enough, when they firſt come of years, though advantaged by a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble education, and others (as before ſaid) taken away early from their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents, and both educated in a contrary Religion, and made zealous Proſelytes of it. Which things how they ſhould be conſiſtent with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, whereof we ſpeak, is at leaſt very difficult to apprehend. And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly theſe two things have ſtuck more with conſidering men than moſt of the other Arguments that have been brought againſt Infant Baptiſm, and have perhaps given as much trouble to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:36048:193"/>all thoſe, who have duly conſider'd them. But whether they are in truth of that force, which they ſeem to be of, may well be doubted by thoſe, who ſhall conſider this regeneration as the ſtate of Infants requires, or at leaſt makes it reaſonable enough to do; I mean as a weak, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect thing, and rather as the ſeed of a more ſtrong, and perfect rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, than a throughly form'd, and well ſetled one. For ſo if we conceive of it, we ſhall find no great difficulty to apprehend firſt, that where there is not only nothing of a Chriſtian education to excite, and improve it, but a contrary one from the very beginning, and ſuch a one in particular as Chriſtian Children have from the <hi>Turks;</hi> So, I ſay, it will not be difficult to apprehend, but it may be perfectly overwhelm'd, and choaked by it: As that ſeed in the Parable was, that was ſown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Thorns, or as that may be ſuppos'd to be, that is covered over with rubbiſh, and hindred by it from ſprouting forth. And though I cannot ſay the ſame of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of ſuch perſons, as have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:36048:194"/>had a Chriſtian, and it may be a careful education to excite it (for here one would think it ſhould every where more forcibly exert it ſelf) yet this I may, which will be of equal force, that in that caſe it may equally fail for want of thoſe perſons exciting it, in whom that ſeed is ſown, or of their anſwering by their care, and endeavour that education, which is made uſe of in order to it. For Baptiſm (as hath been often ſaid) being in the nature of a ſtipulation, or Contract, where ſomewhat is to be perform'd by the party Baptized, as ſoon as he is in a capacity to do it, as well as by him, with whom the contract is made; No wonder if, when the baptized perſon comes to be in a capacity to perform his part, and doth not, he with whom the Contract is made, do firſt withdraw his bleſſing from that, which he hath before ſown in him, and afterward the ſeed it ſelf. For in either of theſe caſes we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect ſuch indications, or effects of the Baptiſmal regeneration, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we might, and as do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhew themſelves in many of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:36048:194"/>thoſe, who have been made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it. It may be enough that God hath furniſh'd ſuch perſons with a regeneration, which during their minority will qualifie them for, and ſecure them to his Kingdom, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation too which, if well improv'd, will grow into a more complete, and effectual one, and in fine bring them to a due holineſs, and unto God. If the baptized perſons will, when they are in a capacity to do better, neglect to excite it, or will oppoſe it, they muſt thank themſelves, if they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, and not lay the blame upon any failure on Chriſt's part, and much leſs deny his having conferred it on them.</p>
               <p>The third, and laſt great Objection againſt the Baptiſm of Infants is their being incapable of anſwering what is prerequired to it on the part of the perſons that are to be baptized, or is to be performed by them in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it. Which incapacity they argue, as to the former of theſe, from the Scripture's pre-requiring Faith, and Repentance to it, as the latter from that ſtipulation, which Baptiſm involves, and which Infants are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapacitated to make.</p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:36048:195"/>
               <p> The Anſwer, which our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm makes to theſe difficulties, or at leaſt to the former, is, that <hi>they promiſe them both by their ſureties, which promiſe, when they come to Age, themſelves are bound to perform.</hi> And poſſibly this Anſwer might be better digeſted than it is, if the minds of thoſe, who argue againſt Infant-Baptiſm, were more free, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd, than they commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be. Becauſe firſt what is urg'd againſt Infant-Baptiſm upon the account of its being a ſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Contract is equally of force againſt the Circumciſion of Infants, becauſe that was equally a Covenant, or rather a ſign of it, and a means of entring into it. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Infants of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſterity were by the Command of God himſelf admitted to it, and thereupon reckon'd as in Covenant with him. Now if the Infants of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſterity were by the Command of God admitted into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him; What ſhould hinder the Infants of Chriſtians from Covenanting in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with him, and ſo far forth from
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:36048:195"/>being admitted to the participation of that Sacrament, which is a ſign of the ſame gracious Covenant, and a means of entring into it? Again Secondly, though Infants cannot in ſtrictneſs Covenant with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither having <hi>reaſon</hi> enough to apprehend the terms of it, nor <hi>will</hi> to determine themſelves to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them; Yet as they may <hi>by favour</hi> be admitted to a partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in a Covenant, and where God, or Chriſt is the perſon, with whom they contract, obliged when they come of years to anſwer their part in it, ſo by the ſame favour of him, with whom they contract, what is done to them, or for them, may be interpreted as a promiſe on their part for the performance of it. By which means though they ſhould not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a ſtrict, and proper ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, yet they may of that, which is interpretatively ſuch. The only farther doubt in this affair is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God accepts of ſuch a ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which his accepting of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Circumciſion, and from the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural poſterity will eaſily remove.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:36048:196"/>For the Covenant of Baptiſm being no way inferior in it ſelf to (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the ſame Covenant in a different dreſs with) the Covenant of Circumciſion, nor the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual ſeed inferior to thoſe of the natural one; What was accepted of under the Covenant of Circumciſion, and from the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed may as reaſonably be preſum'd to be accepted of under Baptiſm, and from the Children of his ſpiritual. How much more, when (as was before ſhewn) his Son, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt<note n="(g)" place="margin">Mark 10.14.</note> hath commanded Children to be brought to him for his benediction, and grace, and his Apoſtle and our great Inſtructer S. <hi>Paul</hi> declar'd the Children of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be <hi>holy,</hi> yea where but one of the Parents is ſo? Thus we may rationally anſwer what is objected againſt the ſtipulation of Infants, and conſequently againſt their taking upon them what is requir'd of them in the receiving of Baptiſm; Which will leave nothing to us to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to, but their ſuppoſed incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for that faith, and repentance,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:36048:196"/>which ſeem to be pre-required to it, and which one would think they, that are to be baptiz'd, ſhould bring with them in ſome meaſure, as well as make a promiſe of. But beſide that thoſe Texts<note n="(h)" place="margin">Mark 16.15, 16. Acts 2.38. Acts 8.37.</note>, which ſpeak of theſe prerequiſites, do all mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly relate to adult perſons, and ſuch as are brought to Baptiſm by the preaching of the Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not lightly to be urg'd in the caſe of Infants; There are theſe three ſubſtantial reaſons to make a difference between Infants, and Men as to this particular. Firſt, that Infants are not admitted to Baptiſm, and the graces of it upon the account of any right in themſelves, but of the right of their Parents. Secondly, that they are admitted for the preſent to a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer portion of the Divine graces, than adult perſons are, and ſuch as are rather the ſeeds of them, than any throughly form'd, or well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ones. Thirdly, that what right they receive by their Baptiſm to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and more perfect priviledges, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends for their actually attaining them upon their exhibiting that faith, and repentance, which at the time of their
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:36048:197"/>Baptiſm they only made a promiſe of. For if (as is alledged in the firſt reaſon) Infants are not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Baptiſm and the Graces of it, upon the account of any right in themſelves, but of the right of their Parents; What ſhould hinder <hi>the Church from lending</hi>

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:36048:197"/>not to be urg'd as to the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which was prerequired of the other? In fine if (as is alledged in the third reaſon) what right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants receive by their Baptiſm to future, and more perfect priviledges, depends for their attaining of them, upon their exhibiting that Faith, and Repentance, which at the time of their Baptiſm they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a promiſe of; It may be time enough, when that right is to be actuated, to exhibit that Faith, and Repentance, and ſo make way for it, as they, who are of years, do. Otherwiſe more ſhall be ſuppos'd to be requir'd of Infants, than is of adult perſons themſelves; Becauſe that Faith and Repentance is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of the latter, till the full pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Baptiſm are to be beſtow'd upon them. And I ſhall only add, that if care were taken that the Faith, and Repentance of thoſe, who were baptiz'd in their Infancy, were as well enquir'd into, and prov'd as their knowledge in the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> is, before they were allow'd to be confirm'd; The Church would not only bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcharge the truſt, that is repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

For ſo ſhe would make it appear, that though ſhe contented her ſelf in their Baptiſm with the promiſe that was made for them, or rather with that tacit ſtipulation, which their very Baptiſm involves; Yet ſhe was as mindful, when they came of years, to oblige them to the performance of it, and to give due proofs in their own perſons of all thoſe things, which Baptiſm in adult perſons doth either pre-ſuppoſe, or oblige to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of.</p>

               <p>Of what force theſe Objections are, ſhall be afterward conſidered; The only reaſon of my preſent mention of them is to ſhew, that the queſtion is not without its difficulty, and that if we will ſatisfie our underſtandings ſo, as to be able to ſatisfie others, we muſt enquire into the grounds of the Churches opinion, as well as be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the Church hath been ſo perſuaded.

I ſay not the ſame, nor can of that unity of Baptiſm, which imports only a ſingle adminiſtration of it to one, and the ſame perſon; That unity, though it may oblige the perſon to ſtick cloſe to his Religion, and to the profeſſion he hath made of it in that <hi>one</hi> Baptiſm of his, yet perſwading not any adheſion to, or unity with other Baptized perſons, than as they may be ſuppos'd to partake <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> with him in it. But it may be there is more force in what is alledged from our Saviour, where he ſaith<note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 13.20.</note>, that <hi>he, that is waſhed,</hi> even by a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral waſhing, <hi>needeth not ſave to waſh his feet.</hi> And ſo no doubt there
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:36048:201"/>is, if by the former <hi>waſhing be</hi> meant the <hi>waſhing</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as ſome of the Antients conceiv'd, and as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="(b)" place="margin">Part 2.</note> made it probable. But there is this exception againſt it, as to the thing we are now about, that it ſeems to ſuppoſe the more general purity procured by it to abide, and mens affections, or actions only to have ſome pollution in them. Whereas thoſe, concerning whoſe rebaptization we intreat, either never had, or have forfeited their baptiſmal regeneration, or fallen off altogether from that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to which it belongs.</p>
               <p>Now that, which in my opinion ought to have the firſt place in our thoughts is the no direction there is in Scripture for the repetition of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, where the like Apoſtaſie, or impiety hath happened, but rather a direction to a contrary courſe. And I inſtance for the proof thereof in <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> after he had deny'd, and forſworn his Maſter; And in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> after he had proceeded to ſo great a degree of impiety, as to offer the Apoſtles money for the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For to the former of theſe even S. <hi>Peter,</hi> we find no
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:36048:201"/>other waſhing directed, ſave that<note n="(c)" place="margin">Luk. 22.61.</note> of <hi>penitential tears;</hi> Nay we find him admoniſhed<note n="(d)" place="margin">Luk. 22.22.</note>, as well as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed after that <hi>converſion</hi> of his to ſet himſelf to the <hi>ſtrengthning of his brethren.</hi> Which in all probability he would not have been without a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Baptiſm, if our Saviour had meant for the future, that nothing but a new Baptiſm ſhould be able to convert ſuch Apoſtates to himſelf: His paſſing over ſo great an Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in a prime diſciple of his upon his bare repentance being apt to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage other men to preſume of the ſame unto themſelves. Neither will it avail to ſay, that this inſtance will not reach the caſe, becauſe it doth not appear, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was baptiz'd before. For ſuppoſing that he were not, which yet (as was heretofore<note n="(e)" place="margin">Part 2.</note> obſerv'd) in all probability he was, the caſe of the Rebaptizers will not be render'd better, but rather ſo much the worſe for it. For if he was not baptiz'd before, there was the more reaſon he ſhould be baptized now, if nothing but a new Baptiſm generally can waſh away Apoſtaſie. The inſtance of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is yet
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:36048:202"/>more clear, and unexceptionable, where the regeneration of Baptiſm hath not been before receiv'd, or forfeited after the receiving of it. For that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> either never receiv'd, or had now loſt the Baptiſmal regeneration, is evident from the words of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to him; That holy man not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly curſing him<note n="(f)" place="margin">Acts 8.20.</note> 
                  <hi>for his offer of money,</hi> but telling him in expreſs terms, that <hi>he had neither lot, nor part in</hi> the <hi>matter</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Acts 8.21.</note> of Chriſtianity, and <hi>that his heart was not right in the ſight of God,</hi> in fine that he perceiv'd, that <hi>he was in the gall of bitterneſs</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Acts 8.23.</note>, <hi>and in the bond of iniquity.</hi> Which notwithſtanding, the ſame S. <hi>Peter</hi> directed him only<note n="(i)" place="margin">Acts 8.22.</note> to <hi>repent of that his wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven him.</hi> Which how could S. <hi>Peter</hi> have done, eſpecially in ſo notorious a caſe, if a ſecond Baptiſm had been neceſſary to waſh away that ſinful eſtate, which the former Baptiſm had not purg'd, or at leaſt which had returned after it.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Argument againſt the repetition of Baptiſm is the no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it in either of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:36048:202"/>inſtances. As will appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider it as a means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us to that piety, which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion requires, or as a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the graces of it. For in the former notion it is as really, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually an obligation to a Chriſtian life in an unſincere perſon, or one who afterwards apoſtatizeth, as if it had been never ſo heartily intended; The obligation thereof ariſing not from the ſecret ſentiments of the perſon, that is baptized, or his conſtancy to his profeſſion, but from the nature of the thing it ſelf, and the Inſtitution of God, that preſcrib'd it. Provided therefore we take upon us the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, we tie our ſelves by it without remedy, neither can there therefore be any need of our obliging our ſelves by it a ſecond time, unleſs he, who inſtituted it, ſhould require it of us. It is true indeed ſo far as we have departed from it whether by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie, or impiety, ſo far it will concern us to own it again to our Lord, and Maſter, by our repentance of the breaches of it, and a repetition of the ſame vows unto him; And it will concern us too, if the Church
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:36048:203"/>requires it, to ſatisfie that alſo, that we do ſo repent, and will amend. But as both the one, and the other may be done without the repetition of our Baptiſm, ſo a frank acknowledgment with our mouths, together with the receit of the Lord's Supper, may very well ſerve for thoſe purpoſes, becauſe ſerving a like to declare them. But it may be the principal difficulty in this affair lies in what concerns Baptiſm as a means of conveying the graces of it, and particularly our regeneration, and new birth. And I muſt confeſs I was for ſome time at a loſs what to think in it, till I conſider'd that the Sacrament of Baptiſm was not either a phyſical cauſe, or conveyer of Grace, that we ſhould think the grace of it could not be in the receiver of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, unleſs it were either preſently produced in him, or conveyed to him, but a moral inſtrument thereof, or a means to which God hath annexed the promiſe of it. For ſuch a one by the favour of that God, who hath annexed the promiſe of his Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, may operate at a diſtance, as well as in preſence, and accordingly may convey it to the receiver of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:36048:203"/>as well after his Baptiſm, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, yea convey it after the baptized perſon hath loſt it, as well as it did at firſt. Which ſuppos'd, the only remaining difficulty will be, whether we may reaſonably expect it from God, ſuppoſing the baptized perſon to return, and repent. A thing, which they have little reaſon to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, who believe God to allow a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Baptiſm upon it, and we ſhall have far leſs, if we reflect upon the former inſtances of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> For if God will allow of the remedy of a ſecond Baptiſm upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, why not alſo allow the firſt Baptiſm to be the means of conveying his graces, and our health, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Eſpecially, when the breaches of it come to be acknowledged, and the vow thereof renewed. And if God accepted of S. <hi>Peter</hi> upon his bare repentance, and directed <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to no other remedy, than that, and prayer; We may as well ſuppoſe, that if he accept us at all, he will accept us upon that, and our old Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and ſo make that co-operate to the reſpective graces of it.</p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:36048:204"/>
               <p> Theſe I take to be ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the repetition of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the more, becauſe they alſo ſuggeſt as ſatisfactory anſwers to what hath been before alledged for it. For neither can they be look'd upon as Heathen, and conſequently as ſtanding in need of a new Baptiſm, who how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may have renounc'd the old, whether by their Impiety, or Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, yet ever were, and ever will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obligation of it. And much leſs after their repentance, and return can they be thought to want it toward the producing of that regeneration, which they are without: Their former Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, through the favour of him who annex'd the promiſe of regeneration to that Sacrament, being as effectual for that purpoſe, as any new Baptiſm what ſoever. Baptiſm is indeed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally neceſſary to regeneration, it is ſo neceſſary that no man living can promiſe it to himſelf without it; But if it be of as much value, as neceſſity, it may, and no doubt will induce him, who is the diſpenſer of his own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to confer it upon a former, as well as upon any new adminiſtration of it.</p>
